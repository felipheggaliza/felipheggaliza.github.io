<p>There is no better companion for a long trip than a podcast. Familiar voices talking
about familiar topics, listened on demand. Definitely better than turning the radio on
and following some random program that's scheduled for that day at that time.</p>

<p>I've been podcasting since 2005 and my numbers have always been modest. 
I know I'm not that good, it's my hobby and it makes me happy. However, I've always
wondered why people are turning away from the audio format, since it was so popular during
the radio days. Maybe there was nothing better back then? Given the choice, nowadays 
the audience will prefer images, text and video over audio.</p>

<p>Now, I'd like to test the viability of podcasting as a format.</p>

<h4>A game of numbers</h4>

<p>In the US there are some shows which are more popular than ever, and
even mid-range podcasters can produce with regularity and getting a fair number of sponsors.
On the other hand, in Spain, I'd say 80% of the population doesn't know
what a podcast is. <em>They've never even heard the word</em>. </p>

<p>For most of us, our audience is a niche. That usually means it's less abundant but more committed.
Listeners are more vocal, participative, and opinionated than a general audience. They're sincere
and give honest feedback. However, there is an audience ceiling for podcasters; depending
on the topic, your downloads peak may never surpass 10k-50k people. </p>

<p>There is still something that has yet not been tried here, to 
start a podcast with a radio superstar. In the US most senior podcasters are ex-radio hosts.
Maybe if a popular host can publicly quit and announce that they'll start their own show, that
could attract some audience to the format.</p>

<p>We find ourselves with a textbook "chicken or egg" problem. How can professionals
jump to solo podcasting if it is impossible to earn a living?
They can't quit their day job and work 9-5 preparing a show, either daily or weekly. There is just
not enough money in the equation.</p>

<p>In my opinion, it is not really a technical issue. The days of needing to explain
what a RSS is are long gone, thanks to iTunes, podcast apps and embedded audio players.
I know a lot of non-tech people
who listen to radio shows on the internet; that's what podcasting is for them. <em>Off-schedule
radio listening, plus some really bad amateurs</em>. They are probably not wrong.</p>

<p>We won't know
until some professional host tries to close the gap and see if audience trickles down
to us amateurs. But who will be the first? Who will open the can of worms, um, sponsors,
for them to see that podcasting is an acceptable medium to advertise on?</p>

<p>I started podcasting when I was 20 and it was&mdash;still is&mdash;a hobby. But my time
is now more valuable, and while it's ok for hobbies to cost money, it is difficult to justify
the hours it would take to emulate a professional effort and polished product. 
Simply put, if a podcaster
can't earn a few hundreds of bucks a month to contribute to their regular income, it will never
become more than a hobby.</p>

<h4>Interactivity</h4>

<p>I was mentioning before that niche audiences tend to be more cooperative.
They give valuable feedback and fill the comment forms on our web pages.</p>

<p>Well, at least until the age of social media. Now everything has changed.</p>

<p>It used to be that you had a podcast, published it on your blog/website, and people
left some comments. Now the tables have turned; the audience wants to leave the same 
comments, only on <em>their own</em> website. Which, for the overwhelming majority, <em>is Twitter</em>.</p>

<p>It makes some sense. People apparently prefer a crippled comment system, which not only has
a character limit, but also makes it impossible to follow multiple branches of a debate.
In reality, that system allows them to treasure all of the user opinions on a single place,
which is their Twitter profile, akin to a personal website.</p>

<p>We&mdash;notice the first person plural&mdash;love the idea
that someone else may browse our Twitter profile to learn our cool interests and read
our witty criticisms of other people's work. That just doesn't happen, however.</p>

<p>Another interesting feature is that every time one at-mentions an author,
they get notified and get to see your face on a profile picture and maybe drop a quick 'thanks', 
creating a feeling of self-importance.
In blogs, you never know if your comment is even read. </p>

<p>That sounded a bit sarcastic but it's why Twitter has hundreds of millions of users; they
are hoping for a retweet from their idols, big or small.</p>

<p><em>Here's my business card: Name, email, Twitter. Email is too serious, send me a tweet</em>. 
So we do that, and Twitter has become a global identity.
Not Facebook, not about.me, not OpenID, not Google Plus. Our Twitter handle is our online
persona, we use it to network with strangers, so we want to use it as much as possible.</p>

<p>I really see the rationale behind it. It's literally our internet username. There is no
other website since the dawn of the internet that has managed to be used as a global
identification system, and many have tried really hard.</p>

<p>And, like that, Twitter killed the blog comments.</p>

<p>So, what now? Well, now we adapt to this new situation, simple as that. On the positive side,
it has increased comment quantity, even if at the huge expense of quality. And, in a world
where a podcast debating politics only used to get 0.1% of its audience to comment, that may
be a good thing.</p>

<h4>Discoverability</h4>

<p>You know what else Twitter is killing? Organic search and directories. Content discovery is
now done via social media, and that definitely is a good thing. An audience of 10 committed listeners
who are referred by a friend who knows their taste is worth 1000 random visits from Google.
Those 1000 visits will never even listen to a minute of your audio. They'll think, <em>"bah,
it's not text/video"</em> and close the browser tab.</p>

<p>Generalizing, there are two kinds of audio listeners, the ones who have a podcast app
with their favorite shows and have integrated podcast listening into their daily workflows, like 
running or commuting, and the rest. That majority are casual listeners, who aren't used
to consume content in an audio format. It's not that they don't have the time;
some people will block half their morning to watch a Minecraft
show on Youtube, but won't listen to a 40-minute podcast on their way to school.</p>

<p><em>Unless?</em></p>

<p>Well, unless they really like it. There's no trick here, people only do stuff that either makes
them feel good, or they get paid for. </p>

<p>How to get people to quickly check out our 90-minute podcast? They can't just skim audio as 
if it were text. </p>

<p>Here's where micro podcasts may help. 
A micro podcast could be defined as an audio file with the following characteristics:</p>

<ul>
<li>Self contained, i.e. not an excerpt or a slice of a full show</li>
<li>No longer than 5-7 minutes</li>
<li>Has the same quality of a full show, including audio production and contents</li>
</ul>

<p>My theory is that there is excellent podcast content, but unlike text and video, it is very
difficult for a potential listener to decide if they are going to like it. Thus, they
don't make the investment of listening to a couple long episodes to make that decision.</p>

<p>I'm currently experimenting with a podcast-in-a-tweet. It's like a regular micro podcast, but
the main distribution channel is Twitter. The audio is actually hosted somewhere, but my marketing
strategy is 100% focused on Twitter.</p>

<p>That's ideal because it appears in front of the
audience exactly at a point when they are predisposed 
to consume content, since they are in fact browsing Twitter. Furthermore, they
don't need to leave the page or perform another action, like subscribing or downloading a file.</p>

<p><em>Click and listen</em>. Since the episode is very short, the user is still there, in front of
a text box, when the show finishes. That directly
invites the audience to participate and share while they are still inclined to do so, as opposed
to long podcasts which are consumed in a scenario where the listener is unable to interact,
like driving or jogging.</p>

<p>Us podcasters may succeed if we can lure the general audience 
into becoming sporadic audio consumers. Then we should fight to make them regular podcast listeners,
but not before.
We have to get the format out of the way, at least 
initially, and push our best content as digestible pills.</p>

<div style="text-align: center">******</div>

<p>I don't know if that will work, it's a wild bet. Right now, since I just started, most of my audience
still listens from a podcast app. I guess that old habits die hard, and a person who
consumes many shows has little incentive to change their workflow. For them, the micropodcast
is in the same category as a regular one, and treat is as such.</p>

<p>Let's try to reach out of our regular audience, the ones who don't have a podcast app.
In a few months from now, and thanks to Twitter's new analytics, I'd love to see that the number
of casual listeners surpasses the number of subscribers. My goal is not that they end up
subscribing to the show, but rather to see a huge spike of social-driven listeners 
when a brilliant episode is produced, similar to what happens when awesome content
is published in other formats.</p>

<p>If you are a podcaster or a listener, I'd love to hear your opinion.
I really want to see people who never cared for audio listening to micro podcasts. That'd be
an enormous achievement.</p>
