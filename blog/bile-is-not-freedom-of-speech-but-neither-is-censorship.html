<p>Twitter&mdash;and most sites which support user comments&mdash;are filled with filth. Unfortunately, that's an indisputable
rule of the internet. Some people are just unaware of the power of their words, and
write comments that expose the worst of human nature, like the guy who 
<a href="http://elpais.com/elpais/2014/05/16/inenglish/1400232016_588758.html">cheered the murder of a Spanish politician</a></p>

<p>Despicable as that comment is, however, I think that police resources would be better used if going after actual criminals
or corrupt politicians instead of angry teenagers. On the other hand, people should start learning that throwing bile
on internet comments <a href="http://www.elmundo.es/elmundo/2013/06/14/espana/1371230608.html">may be freedom of speech</a> but also an offence of verbal threatening. Let's just start behaving
like intelligent people and try neither to threaten others nor indict dumb twitter users.</p>

<p>My point here is that 
the internet was born free, and it is now turning into a "regular" business: <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7750036">money will pay quality of service</a>,
<a href="http://elpais.com/elpais/2014/02/14/inenglish/1392391558_174426.html">online media will be regulated</a> as if hyperlinks and news excerpts were copyright infringement, and now all 
internet comments will be treated as if they were uttered on the real world; at the main street or on a news outlet.</p>

<p>That is not necessarily bad, <em>per se</em>. However, the people and lobbies regulating the net are the same people who 
<a href="http://cfenollosa.com/blog/the-ignorant-eu-cookie-law.html">think cookies are a menace to user privacy</a> and have strong political and economical interests on putting strong
leashes to users. The internet has been bypassing their establishment for about 20 years and now it's time to put an end to that.</p>

<p>Should the internet be different from the rest of society? It's not a rhetorical question. However, there is no easy answer.
The net has created new idiosyncrasies and, if we change the rules of the game, more things need to change. However, politicians
don't understand&mdash;or don't want to&mdash;this concept. </p>

<p>If they charge business for their QoS, then those business must be able to demand public internet providers 
where there are monopolies
or oligopolies. If a blog can be sued for copyright infringement, so must be TVs that feed from youtube users. The list goes on.</p>

<p>The problem now is that it's too tempting for the establishment to regulate everything in their favor. And, given that they
have the ability to do so, puts democracy to shame. That is, <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/blogs-echochambers-27074746">if there is one</a>.</p>

<p>As incredible as it sounds, the tinfoil-hat people were actually right. 
What's more indignant, teenagers may pay large fines for hate speech while governments steal their naked pictures from their 
webcams and companies take our tax money to turn it against our interests. </p>

<p>Regrettably, for those who didn't know it, that is how
the world has always worked. The internet was a small oasis that lasted a few years and gave us a taste of real freedom,
for the good and the bad&mdash;Silk Road, CP, etc.</p>

<p>What now? I think we should support organizations that <a href="https://www.eff.org">defend our rights</a>, 
<a href="https://www.torproject.org">software that empowers us</a> instead of relying on the <em>bona fide</em> of our providers, and helping develop <a href="https://freenetproject.org">a new internet</a>,
if that were the case.</p>

<p>In Spain, we have a saying "hecha la ley, hecha la trampa". It means that the cheaters will always be one step ahead of the rules.
Applied to the internet, that will be a good thing for users and freedom.</p>
