<p>This classic question from beginners who start coding their own tools for research has only one
correct answer: <b>it depends</b>.</p>

<p>If there is no language which is clearly better than the others, why do I have this very
simple table on my <a href="http://mmb.pcb.ub.es/~carlesfe/#unix">Unix section?</a>

<ol>
<li>Bash, awk are your first choice</li>
<li>PHP if you require more power</li>
<li>C only if you know why</li>
<li>Use Java &amp; Eclipse</li>
</ol>

<p>Don't get me wrong, this table has been compiled from quite a few years of experience, and there are
huge assumptions behind it. The first one is that you still don't know what language you should use. If there
is no doubt, either because there are some requirements for the project or because there is a language that is
designed specifically for that task (e.g. <code>CLIPS</code> for declarative programming), then you need to
ask yourself some questions.</p>

<p>I'll start by enumerating the most popular language choices and some of their features</p>


<h4>Scripting languages</h4>

<p>Scripting languages are good for small or medium projects, because they fit very well with the
line of thought of the programmer. This means you can program while you think, which isn't the best for
cleanliness, but it gets the work done quickly</p>

<ul>
<li><code><b>bash</b></code> is always your first choice. You already know how to run stuff in the command
line, right? So this is basically the same. <code>bash</code> can handle functions and arrays, but that's
pretty much all it can do. However, that's usually good enough for small routines, and you can
always call other Unix tools. It also avoids the overhead of running another binary (<code>perl</code>,
<code>php</code>) as it is already in memory.</li>

<li><code><b>perl</b></code> is great to parse text, but slow for anything else. If you need to parse
text <b>and</b> do math, use <code>php</code>, which has a faster math engine. It also lacks objects.
However, there are very
good scientific libraries for it, so you might be forced to use this language anyway.</li>

<li><code><b>php</b></code> has nice libraries to connect to databases and in general do web stuff. It is
also object oriented, so it is a suitable candidate for small-medium projects which can benefit from
object orientation but don't need all the infrastructure from <code>java</code> or <code>C++</code>. In general,
unless you are tied to <code>perl</code>, <code>php</code> is a better choice.</li>

<li><code><b>python</b></code> is, well, another scripting language. It's way better than <code>perl</code>, and
functionally similar to <code>php</code>, so you might want to use it if you like its clean syntax or
need to call other <code>python</code> libraries.<br/>
<i>Edit: after having used python for a long time, it is the first language I'd recommend for most
use cases</i>
</li>

<li><code><b>ruby</b></code> is so painfully slow that you should avoid it at any costs. I am including it
here only to warn other people against using it.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Compiled languages</h4>

<p>Once you start compiling code, things get complicated. However, the results are usually great, fast,
and very maintainable. Let's discuss the alternatives.</p>

<ul>
<li><code><b>java</b></code> why <code>java</code> first? Because it's the most appropriate. It has great
developing tools (Eclipse), it checks a lot of stuff in compile time, it does not
need that the programmer uses pointers&mdash;it uses pointers internally, but transparently&mdash;and
in general is a modern, object-oriented language, which doesn't require legacy stuff like headers. Yes,
it is a bit slower than pure <code>C</code>, but the latest versions of the java virtual machine
compile to machine code on runtime and achieve great performance. Most computer scientists have
mastered it and in general it is widely extended. It is versatile and can be used from simple routines
to implement web pages with <code>JSP</code>, to CRMs. Yes, I like <code>java</code>.</li>

<li><code><b>C</b></code> is the mother of all programming languages, but this does not mean that it's the
best one. It's old, doesn't have objects, and for every byte optimization which earns 1 second of
execution time, the programmer needs to waste ten minutes. Optimizations should be done at the compiler
level, not the code level. However, <code>C</code> has great compilers, from the good-enough <code>gcc</code>
to the awesome <code>icc</code>. <br/>
My recommendation is that you use it only if you know what you're doing. It's
awful to parse strings in <code>C</code>, it lacks many scientific libraries compared to
<code>perl</code> or <code>java</code>&mdash;except math functions, but that's what <code>R</code> is for&mdash;and
the segmentation faults in general can make you waste several days
looking into the code because you declared a variable incorrectly and you have a pagination issue.<br/>
Some might argue that <code>C</code> is as good as the programmer is, but honestly, it makes good
programmers waste a lot of time because of small issues.</li>

<li><code><b>C++</b></code> is the alternative if you need to use <code>C</code> in an object-oriented
environment. The compiler is also able to run more checks in compile time, so you'll waste less time,
but I'd go for <code>java</code> anyway. There is no reason to choose <code>C++</code> a priori but execution
speed</li>

<li><code><b>objective-C</b></code> Apple users are sometimes tempted to write <code>obj-C</code> code, because
of the excellent development tools on a Mac, but keep in mind that probably there is nobody else
who can look at that code afterwards and understand it, because almost nobody uses <code>obj-C</code>.
So I'd suggest not to use it unless you're in a hardcore Mac environment or are planning to develop
a GUI for a Mac afterwards.</li>

<li><code><b>fortran</b></code> there are only two kinds of people who use <code>fortran</code>: physicists
and the poor fellows who have to maintain their code afterwards. It was designed for the 50s computers,
which means that using it nowadays would be like using steering wheels from John Ford on today's cars.
It is easier to understand <code>f2c</code> generated code than the original one. There is not a single
reason to use
<code>fortran</code>. If you need raw speed use <code>C</code>. If you want to write unmaintainable code,
well, use obfuscated <code>perl</code>.</li>
</ul>


<h4>Choosing a language</h4>

<p>Now for the difficult task of choosing a language. If you look again at the four items on top of
this post, having read the language descriptions above, you might start to see what's going on. This is
basically a matter of choosing the right language for your specific task, with some decisions.</p>

<p><b>Which are my time constraints?</b> Beginner programmers often forget that, for homemade software,
the total time constraint is <i>the time you spend programming</i> plus <i>the time you spend running it</i>.
If the routine is expected to take 10 minutes, don't waste two hours writing a C program with pointers, write
a simple script.</p>

<p><b>Can I solve it with a simple script?</b> If the answer is yes, use <code>bash</code>. It's a great
scripting language, and you can build on top of other Unix tools, like <code>awk</code>, <code>sed</code>, etc.</p>

<p>However, keep in mind that every time you call an external program, the system needs to <code>fork()</code>
and, for large loops, this can be a huge overhead. Be rational, and think again of the execution time.
Instead to launch 10,000 <code>sed</code> to parse lines, it might be better to write a <code>php</code> script, which
is more powerful than <code>bash</code>, it won't need to <code>fork()</code> and the code will probably be simpler.</code>

<p><b>Will I need to maintain it or reuse the code? Will the code grow?</b> If you think this code can be
reused as a library, or integrated into other modules, think of making it into an actual <code>C</code> library
or <code>java</code> class. Running scripts within scripts within a big project is generally a bad idea. And
please keep in mind that, in a research environment, at some point another person will need to look
at your code, so besides writing clean and understandable code, try not to use obscure languages or tools
which only you know of.</p>

<p><b>Do I need to achieve the maximum speed and/or optimizations?</b> Keeping in mind that the latest
versions of the <code>java</code> virtual machine are pretty fast, yes, the winner here is <code>C</code>. But we're
talking about software which can take you two weeks to code, and which would take months to run if written
in <code>perl</code>, but only takes three hours when coded in <code>C</code>. When this happens, choose <code>C</code>.</p>

<p><b>Will it need to run on different platforms?</b> <code>java</code> and the scripting languages are the only
ones which guarantee perfect execution on every environment: Windows, Mac, Linux, Solaris, BSD and others.
<code>C</code> can be compiled in different architectures but it's sometimes hard to replace <code>mmap</code>'s
on Windows or compile against different versions of the <code>libc</code> in different flavors of Linux.</p>

<h4>Summary</h4>

<p>Let's review the four initial points again.</p>

<ol>
<li><code><b>bash</b></code> is a great initial choice for small projects which will take about 20 minutes
to run and you don't want to waste three hours programming them</li>
<li><code><b>php</b></code> is appropriate for medium projects, which use objects, parse text and do math.
<code>perl</code> is another good choice at this point.</li>
<li><code><b>C</b></code> is better left for experts or people who need hardcore optimizations. The rest
of us will leave optimizations for the compiler/interpreter and just try to write good code
which runs in O(n) if possible.</li>
<li><code><b>java</b></code> is the king of tools and libraries, multi-platform, scales great for big
projects, is surprisingly fast and very respectful with novices. Its only drawback is the need of
a <code>java</code> virtual machine, but hey, if you use <code>perl</code> you will need its libraries
installed, too.</li>
</ol>

<p>In the end, everyone has their preferred languages, which is fine. It is far more important to write good
code than it is to choose the language which fits best for a task. However, failing to foresee the importance
of a math routine in the and writing it in <code>perl</code> can lead to the whole research group wasting
time until somebody else writes it in <code>C</code> and makes it 1000x faster. Yep, true story.
So choose wisely.</p>
