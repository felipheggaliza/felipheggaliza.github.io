<p>One of the things I always regretted from college is that our hardware hands-on experience was pretty meager.
We designed a lot of digital circuits but never got to build one, not even on a breadboard.</p>

<p>A great perk of taking a sabbatical year is that you can learn whatever the hell you want. Like, for example,
complementing your college degree with those topics you used to love but couldn't experiment with enough. 
Money + free time + engineering curiosity = win.</p>

<p>I used to build computers from components long ago, but that was too much of a hassle, plus you had to keep
up to date with new technologies which essentialy made everything incompatible with last years'. So it may not be
the best of the ideas to go back to that.</p>

<p>I found an interesting crowdfunding campaign: <a href="https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/pi-top-a-raspberry-pi-laptop-you-build-yourself">Pi-Top</a>, a laptop you build yourself.
It's basically a bit of electronics + 3D printing + the power of a Raspberry Pi + some robotic modules (HATs).
An excellent way to dive into electronics without hurting oneself too much.</p>

<p>The 2010s are every engineer's dream. Hardware is cheap and nicely packaged into higher level
components, there are plenty of sensors, wireless is everywhere, batteries can last forever on low-power
chips, and there is plenty of documentation on the Internet. In a couple years, 3D printers will be cheap enough 
to buy one for home; meanwhile, there are <a href="https://www.3dhubs.com/barcelona">3D printing hubs</a> that you can reach
to print any design.</p>

<p>It's a fantastic time to buy breadboard, some chips, and build simple circuits,
like a clock, some light control with sensors, wireless remotes, etc. And those <em>can finally have real life
applications</em>. Just a few years ago, without ubiquitous wireless, homemade circuits were just a novelty.
Nowadays you can build yourself a sweet home automation system for a few bucks if you know how.</p>

<p>I can't wait for my Pi-Top to arrive.</p>

<p>I am a Computer Engineer major, so I took some classes in college on how to build
operating systems. For many reasons, I don't remember most of it, but it is a world
which has always excited me.</p>

<p>There has been a <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8380822">recent post on HN</a>
which points to a <a href="http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/~exr/lectures/opsys/10_11/lectures/os-dev.pdf">very simple and detailed tutorial on how to write an OS
from scratch</a>
and it has really inspired me, so I decided to <a href="https://github.com/cfenollosa/os-tutorial">create a Github repo to publish
the code at the same pace that I learn to write it</a>.</p>

<p>It is not for everyone; rather, for CS/CE majors who were overwhelmed by college
but always were curious about what happens from the moment you turn on your
machine up until when an application loads.</p>

<p>I split each "lesson" into one-concept increments, so it can be easy to follow
for people like me who don't have a lot of time and brain power to learn at a University
pace. This is a work in progress, again, I publish code while I learn and extract it from
the original document and other internet resources, so expect it to be updated
regularly!</p>

<p>Some years ago I started reading on mechanical keyboards, and bought 
an <a href="http://deskthority.net/wiki/Apple_Extended_Keyboard_II">AEKII</a>.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, despite the positive reviews, I didn't like the keys at all. The sound
was damp, and the key feeling was horrible. Honestly, I was expecting something similar
to a Model M, and this was really a different story.</p>

<p>I decided to open it and take a look inside, and with the help of some people I managed to
hack the sound of its keyswitches, the complicated (white) Alps. 
<a href="https://github.com/cfenollosa/aekii">I wrote a guide</a> and uploaded it to Github.</p>

<p>A few days ago I received some feedback with more ideas, and I decided to update the guide.
It's amazing how you write some guide on Github that probably nobody will ever read, and some years
after you can still receive comments and improve on the sound of your keyboard.</p>

<p>Right now I am still undecided if I go again with the AEKII with its new clicky, buckling spring like
sound, or keep using the tiny <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00BEVVFD0/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B00BEVVFD0&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=carlofenol-20&amp;linkId=DS4QGWW66L6E26D5">Filco 67-key</a>
which allows the mouse to be much closer to your right hand when you're typing. Boy, the AEKII is <em>huge</em>.</p>

<p>Besides the hardware modifications, in <a href="https://github.com/cfenollosa/aekii">the guide</a> you will
also find some scripts and ideas that you can use <a href="http://cfenollosa.com/blog/redefining-your-keyboard.html">to redefine your keyboard</a>, type faster, and suffer less RSI. If you're still using the vanilla Caps Lock key,
please read both articles.</p>

<p>I live in Spain, so most of the computers I work on have a Spanish keyboard layout. We really
need it for the accents, <em>&ntilde;, &ccedil;</em> and other language-related keys.</p>

<p>However, when it comes to programming, the Spanish layout seems... designed by Spaniards. Well, not actually.
It is designed for writers, not programmers, which makes sense because it follows old typewriter's layouts.</p>

<p>For example, colons need an additional shift key press, the slash is inconveniently located above the number seven,
so you need to perform an exercise of finger gymnastics to press it, braces need AltGr, etc. It is very, very inefficient,
and it also leads to hand strains and finger pain after a few hours of work.</p>

<p>After some time considering it, I asked for a US keyboard, and voil&agrave;, programming is a lot easier now. For me, the
major improvement is the location of the slash, widely used in UNIX, but also braces and the pipe. Sure, it takes some time
getting used to it, but after about a month of daily use one can perfectly type with, at least, their original typing speed&mdash;
if not even more&mdash;with the included benefit of less finger movement.</p>

<p>Accents can be typed anyway, either by pressing Alt-Letter or mapping them to any other combination. In any case, when I need to type a long
text in any language other than English, I just press my layout-change key and use the Spanish keyboard again.</p>

<p>Windows, Linux and Macs allow you to change keyboard layouts on the fly by just pressing a key. With a couple of Google searches
you should be able to learn how to do it, it's real easy. However, there's more! I recently discovered another trick which might
be useful for your work.</p>

<p>Don't you feel your fingers a little bit tired after working with screen, Emacs or any program which uses Ctrl?
That's because the Control key is located
down in the keyboard and you need to stretch your fingers to Ctrl-A and Ctrl-E. A hidden feature of all operating systems also allows you
to move it up, to the home row of your keyboard. Would you mind checking if there's some key you don't use that often which
might be suitable to replace Ctrl? Caps Lock, indeed!</p>

<p>Caps Lock is a huge key which has no practical use except for twelve-year-olds on Youtube, and it is placed so close to A and E
that it would be a sin not to make it behave like Ctrl. Again, do a quick Google search, and learn how to remap it. It can be done with
the GUI, no need to change configuration files. And, were you in need to use Caps Lock for some reason, you can always
map Shift-CapsLock to its old behavior.</p>

<p>From now on, I encourage you to think about remapping keys that you don't use. Personally, I have the Windows key remapped to
switch layouts, CapsLock as a Ctrl and the F1..F12 as desktop keys: move one desktop to the left, right, move windows to another desktop,
lock screen, volume controls, etc. And, now that you're here, take some time to learn or assign keyboard shortcuts to common tasks,
either in the console or in the GUI. You'll work much faster and, more importantly, your hands' health will improve.</p>
