<p>These last months I've been quite busy learning new stuff. Researchers always need
to keep an eye on the state of the art by reading papers, but multi-disciplinar sciences
usually require a strong background in two or more areas, like biology, chemistry, math,
physics or the always present computer science.</p>

<p>While we can appreciate a good book, it is not the ideal way to learn new skills. Books
don't force you to follow a schedule, do the assignments, and obviously don't evaluate you.
We all have work to do and, with no deadlines, we never invest enough time on learning new tools
in depth. Most books and tutorials are abandoned at chapter 4.</p>

<h4>University-grade learning</h4>
<p>If you want to follow an university-like learning methodology, you will need to invest
university-like time and money, enrolling in short courses or traditional Masters
degrees. They are fine, but cost a lot of time and money. What happens if you just want to learn
one specific tool or technique and not a whole curriculum?</p>

<p>Many universities offer workshops and non-official courses, typically for 3-5 days,
which don't cost much money, but they are usually full-time and not really compatible with
a daily job, unless you get permission from your supervisor.</p>

<p>In 2011, and especially in 2012, a new learning tool appeared on the internet: the MOOCs,
or Massive Open Online Courses. Their format varies, but most of them cover one or half a university
class (7-15 weeks) in depth, with video lectures, assignments, deadlines, and real interaction
with other students, TAs and professors.</p>

<p>In learning, it isn't worth to to cheat at solitaire. A hard deadline is the only way to
assure we won't lag behind the class, and while nobody will be watching whether we finish
the course or drop it, it is up to us to decide if we want to take that opportunity to learn
or not.</p>

<h4>Resources to learn online</h4>
<p>If you need some pointers I'd recommend to try <a href='https://www.coursera.org/'>Coursera</a>
first, since it has the best methodology, for my taste, and the one which resembles a college
the most. If I'm not mistaken, it's also the website with the most number of courses. A good
alternative is <a href="https://www.udacity.com/">Udacity</a>, which doesn't have as many advanced
topics as Coursera, but it's great for beginners. Finally, the last generalistic site is
<a href='https://www.khanacademy.org/'>Khan Academy</a>, but unfortunately, it doesn't provide
the same assignments-and-deadline mechanism that the former have. It basically contains video
lectures. As a non-website, we can't forget <a href='http://www.apple.com/education/itunes-u/'>
iTunes U</a>, Apple's video lectures directory, with classes directly recorded from campus.</p>

<p>Other self-learning resources, while not strictly MOOCs, are
<a href='http://www.codeschool.com/'>Codeschool</a> and <a href='http://www.codecademy.com'>
Codeacademy</a> for programming, and <a href='http://www.memrise.com/home/'>Memrise</a> for
languages. The number of education websites is growing, so make a quick search on Google
to check if there is anything else you could be interested in.</p>

<h4>Effort, pace and cost</h4>
<p>MOOCs surprisingly compare to real online universities in terms of quality and
material level, however, real interaction with the professor is difficult and only through
public forums. The number of makes up for that, as usually there is somebody which
can answer you. It is really a collaborative effort.</p>

<p>Besides the obvious "knowledge for all" motto, there's another big advantage for me, as you can study at your own pace. Good MOOCs have
precise deadlines which allow you some margin if you have a hard week at work or home, but
they are not so far enough as to let you lag behind.</p>

<p>Now, the question is, who pays for that? Posting video lectures online has a marginal cost,
but what about the TAs and professor's time? Most of the assignments are corrected by a computer
or other students, but the organizers have to invest a significant amount of money.</p>

<p>I don't have the answer, but probably, since those courses are sponsored by a university,
it probably fits into their social community service. Some professors advertise their books
on the subject, which is perfectly reasonable, and finally, there is usually some self interest
and promotion goal.</p>

<p>Whoever pays for the courses with their time and money, thank you.</p>

<p>Go check these links out, especially Coursera, and see if there's anything that catches
your eye. Be brave, enroll, and prepare for a university-like effort. You'll learn
university-like knowledge, for free.</p>
