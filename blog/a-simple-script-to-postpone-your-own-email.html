<p>I somewhat use email as a task manager. Honestly, I believe we all do. We process emails in the inbox, then archive or delete them when we are done with them.</p>

<p>However, keeping track of emails that need a follow-up on a specific date can be difficult.</p>

<p>Around 2011 I wrote a script to perform that task. It is a very simple IMAP parser that searches for a folder with today's date and moves all its contents to a special folder named "Today".</p>

<p>Let me tell you my email workflow. I understand that not everybody works in the same way, but maybe you can get some ideas to improve your email handling.</p>

<p>My email folder structure looks like this. The interesting part is in bold.</p>

<pre>
Inbox
\_ Mailing lists
\_ Project folders
\_ ...
<strong>
\_ Deadlines
     \_ Today
     \_ Tomorrow
     \_ 2016-01-19
     \_ 2016-02-02
     ...
     \_ 2017-08-01
</strong>
</pre>

<p>I follow the GTD methodology, which essentially states that tasks should either be done on the spot, delegated, or deferred. Thus, my inbox is exclusively for new tasks. A couple of times a day I process incoming email and, like most of us, either delete it, reply to it, forward it or &mdash;this is the interesting part&mdash; move it to one of the "Deadlines" folders.</p>

<p>Instead of using the inbox as the "email task manager", I use a folder named "Today". I've tried both alternatives, and I find that it works best for me. Since it separates new tasks from tasks I've already processed, I can work my entire day on "Today" and totally forget about the Inbox, even if new email is arriving.</p>

<p>The "Tomorrow" folder is just a shortcut so that I don't need to create a new folder with tomorrow's date every day.</p>

<p>As you may have guessed, the script runs once a day in a crontab, at 6 AM, and moves all mail from "Tomorrow" and the folder with tomorrow's date to "Today". That's it. And that "simple trick", as fishy marketers like to say, saves me a lot of time and headaches every day.</p>

<p>There is currently a commercial alternative, <a href="http://www.boomeranggmail.com">Boomerang</a>, which you may find interesting if you aren't comfortable with programming. I haven't used it, so I can't comment on that. In any case, I usually prefer writing a small script rather than using a third-party service.</p>

<p>Update: <a href="https://github.com/kapravel/snoozegmail">this script</a> by Alex Kapravelos does something very similar, 
and it integrates with Google Apps Scripts.</p>

<p><a href="https://gist.github.com/cfenollosa/79c22e2ecbb2bdfee15b">Here it is, as a Gist</a>. 
The code is definitely not the best in the world, but it works. Feel free to use it, modify it (BSD license), give feedback and leave comments.</p>

<p>I hope that you can introduce some ideas from this methodology to your daily workflow. it can be as useful as it's been for me.</p>
