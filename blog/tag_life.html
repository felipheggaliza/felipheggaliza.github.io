What's up with disliking Liking?

<p>Twitter recently changed their faves for likes with much controversy and bashing Facebook's Likes is already a meme. What's up with disliking Liking?</p>

<p>Are we more narcissistic than ever? Maybe we are. Public image has always been important for two groups: public figures and teenagers. </p>

<p>I find myself lucky to have been a teenager in a world without social media. Otherwise, everyone could have been my adolescent cringe-inducing posts that were lost in private ICQ and MSN chats.</p>

<p>People need to feel important, and the new coolness ranking is social media Likes. Years ago, it was (paper) facebook notes and signatures. That's how the world works now, and we can only react to it, not change it.</p>

<p>Us adults tend to frown upon a teen posting a vaguely suggestive picture for their friends to Like but can't seem to enjoy a vacation unless we're sure all our coworkers are green with envy at our beach pictures. We can't start eating until everyone has uploaded a pic of its dish to Instagram as if waiting till mom finishes her prayer. </p>

<p>Technology is always ahead of society. It takes some time for people to adjust to new customs. We added "texting" to the list of things that are rude while dining at a table, then allowed some exceptions for important messages. We considered that leaving a meeting for a phone call is unprofessional, then accepted that people can have legitimate reasons.</p>

<p>Some will eat their dishes cold for some &hearts;s; others will unhealthily link their self-esteem to a particular threshold of Likes, and people will publicly mourn their dead in exchange for some sympathy.</p>

<p>In the end, liking somebody's content is a way of showing that you care about that person. Sympathy makes us human. Some will argue that private things should be kept hidden, but what's wrong if broadcasting their lives make people happy?</p>

<p>Everyone has their individual reasons for providing a Like or not; likewise, they are free to choose whether to publicize a personal event or not. Those who advertise all their illnesses on Facebook are no different than grandmas who go to the park and compete with other grandmas in the so-called ailment Olympics.</p>

<p>People need sympathy; Likes is just the channel that we use in the 2010s to provide it.</p>

<p>Maybe the difference between a junior and a senior programmer is that the first will sometimes
say "I don't know how to do this", while the second will always say "Give me a week".</p>

<p>When you finish college with a computer engineering degree, everything seems possible.
You just learned how to design a computer from the zeros and ones up to the applications.
From logic gates up to a CPU, from TCP to HTTP, from assembler to Java.</p>

<p>Then, time passes, you get a regular job, and regardless of its awesomeness you start forgetting stuff. Furthermore, you discover super smart
people who are light years ahead of you, and for some reason, your mind thinks of them
as superheroes, almost magical creatures who can <a href="http://wiki.qemu.org/Main_Page">write an ultrafast x86 emulator</a>
or <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yHJOz_y9rZE">make a 
disk drive play the Imperial March</a></p>

<p>Don't get me wrong, these are amazing feats. But psychologically you start to feel
dumber and dumber up to the point where you believe that the only thing you can aspire to
is write webpages and some normal stuff. Even if you have great skills and do a great job
at a great company, it's difficult not to feel just a tiny peg of the machine.</p>

<p>I didn't know how to do anything else, and I thought I'd fail if I tried. In college, I suffered
a lot with some courses, and to date I still don't know how I passed. But the truth is that
college is very dense, and without all the stress from exams and projects, and thanks to
age and experience, things actually get easier to learn.</p>

<p>That's why side projects are important.</p>

<p>Three years ago I launched my first successful project to the Internet, <a href="http://cfenollosa.com/blog/creating-a-simple-blog-system-with-a-500-line-bash-script.html">bashblog</a>.
It's no big deal, but it's a commitment. People use it, contribute patches, discuss ideas, and I have the responsibility
to make it work.</p>

<p>Then I started learning things that have always tickled my curiosity. It started with
<a href="https://class.coursera.org/progfun-002">functional programming</a>, one of the academic topics
which has been discussed since the 60s but never took off. Then I did more courses on astrophysics
and statistics. </p>

<p>This year I left my job to take a sabbatical and start new projects. In some countries it's normal
to take a sabbatical before starting college to travel and learn. But almost nobody thinks about
a sabbatical when you're 30. You can choose a wrong career path when you're 18 and fix it, but the
30s are critical and one needs to be really sure that they want to spend the rest of their life
doing what they love.</p>

<p>I have recently found, don't know how to put it, some change of mind, new strength, inspiration.
<a href="https://github.com/cfenollosa/os-tutorial">I want to learn how to write an OS</a>. I started writing
mobile apps. I want to <a href="http://feenbox.com">launch a product</a>. I'm contributing to an industrial patent
to do really cool stuff with cellphones.</p>

<p>As usual, every of these projects hides many challenges. I've had to read RFCs,
learn how to extract voice patterns from an audio file, write device drivers, deal with lawyers and read
formal documents <sup>1</sup></p>

<p>We live in the information age. There are plenty of resources, some of those <a href="http://cfenollosa.com/blog/learn-new-stuff-online-for-free.html">University-grade</a>,
to learn new skills. <a href="http://cfenollosa.com/blog/tips-to-work-from-home.html">Discipline and planning</a> can go a long way.
There is no excuse.</p>

<p>Github and other websites have also made it effortless to collaborate with total strangers. It really makes me
happy and proud to see other people commenting on things I've done. Years ago you had to go to a computer
hobbyist meeting to show your work, now you can do it online... and others will improve it. </p>

<p>Stack Overflow will provide code samples and guidance. I've now
started hearing undergrads utter "Did you really code programs without Stack Overflow?" in the same way
that I used to say "Did you code programs without the internet?" to people who had to read manuals and go to
a library.</p>

<p>Hacker News and Reddit can guide you on what's cool nowadays. 
<a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/startupideas.html">Live in the future, then build what's missing</a>.</p>

<p>I guess that it's comfortable to dismiss some ideas just because "we don't know how to do it".
And that's a waste of our university degrees. We have some responsibility to do cool stuff.
If we don't build it, who will? If we can build it, why wait? If you don't have the skills,
learn them. Just Google it. Work on it for a week, and you will succeed.</p>

<p>Do you miss the adrenaline rush that you used to get when you first discovered something?
The "oooh" and the "aaah"? Learn something new, something radical, something cool and futuristic.
Start a project, and release it. It doesn't need to be complete.</p>

<p>The greatest force that pushes us to build things is the knowledge that nobody else will build them for us.</p>

<p>~~~~~</p>

<p>[1] One of the multiple things that managers usually do and engineers don't appreciate enough</p>

<p><a href="http://www.marco.org/2014/08/29/wirecutter-resolved">Marco posted about some internet drama</a> and I found
the second part of the post quite enlightening.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We allow people access to us 24/7. We're always in public, constantly checking 
an anonymous comment box, trying to explain ourselves to everyone, and trying 
to win unwinnable arguments with strangers who don’t matter in our lives at all.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That is exactly spot on, and that is why I always recommend disabling all notifications on your phone
except for a few important people on Whatsapp. Otherwise, any random person on the internet can
ruin your day at any time with an offensive comment on any public website.</p>

<p>I highly recommend his <em>On productivity</em> section, especially <a href="http://mattgemmell.com/simplicity/">Simplicity</a>,
which I can really relate to.</p>

<p>He's a very talented writer, so if you have some time, read his <em>Personal essays</em> section, which is very

<blockquote>
  <p>I don't care how good it is, I just don't like police shows</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That's what I said after watching the first couple episodes from <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0306414/">The Wire</a></p>

<p>It was a police show with unintelligible dialogs.
Halfway through the first episode I fell asleep. God, wasn't this show the best thing since sliced bread?</p>

<p>After some discussion with my girlfriend and thanks to the insistence of a couple friends, we decided to give
it a go. We would watch the first ten episodes before deciding on anything.</p>

<p>I now look at those first episodes as an investment.</p>

<div style="text-align: center">******</div>

<p>I had fell into the <em>judging a book by its covers</em> capital sin.</p>

<p>The Wire isn't a show about police work in the same fashion as Game of Thrones isn't a book about
a couple of royal bastards. And the comparison is intentional. They are both dramas, they have very strong 
characters, they display brutal death of loved characters, and most important of all, they both show 
how the world works.</p>

<p>Yesterday, I tweeted this:</p>

<p><em>The Wire has shown me how the world works much better than my 30 years of life</em></p>

<div style="text-align: center">******</div>

<p>The Wire is Game of Thrones in a current setting. The similarities are very extensive.</p>

<p>Some police investigate a common crime. By pulling the strings, they start to realize the connections, some of which
are away from their reach. 
The case goes on; it affects higher level characters, the ones below can do nothing about it and complain about
how unfair managers are.</p>

<p>Lower level characters start growing, they are now in the position to change things. Things can't be changed because
of the establishment and diverse interests. Some do the good thing and get punished (<em>no good deed goes unpunished</em>), 
others do bad things for a good reason (<em>the end justifies the means</em>). Most of the times, the result
is independent of the character's behavior or intentions; there are just too many factors to account, too many
people to please, too many interests. Outcomes are chaotic, for the better and the worse.</p>

<p>Some bad guys are not so bad, they are just people who got caught in a spiral of violence. Some manage to get out
of it, some don't. Some die. All bad guys are people, a few are real monsters. The line between good and bad
is only defined by their own ethics. The Wire, like Game of Thrones, reminds us of classical tragedies.</p>

<p>Former pawns are now kings, and start behaving like the old kings because that's the only way they can
act if they want to survive. New pawns complain of new kings like old pawns complained of old kings.</p>

<p>A few characters maintain their integrity only to realize that righteousness is only a virtue when 
aligned with your king's interests. </p>

<div style="text-align: center">******</div>

<p>I can't say much more without spoiling the fun. Besides a strange last season, where characters change
too much and much evidently rushed because of the writers guild strike, the series is a gold mine.</p>

<p>Every chapter exposes some gold nuggets where, if the viewer has been paying attention, he will grasp
the subtle hints, subtle dialog, subtle gazes between characters that anticipate what's going to happen.
And, because not everything can always be planned ahead, those characters will be surprised by other characters
defending their interests.</p>

<p>This show is so delightfully satisfying that consciously deciding not to watch it 
is a sabotage to one's own pleasure.</p>
