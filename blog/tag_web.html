<p>I've always loved email. For me, even in the era of Whatsapp and Facetime, it is the ultimate form of communication.
It can be personal or professional, heartwarming or annoying, instantaneous or asynchronous, small or big, long or short,
easy or godmode.
There are very few times where I prefer a quick IM communication, of course, but the bulk of my day is email.</p>

<p>My first internet on college got me reading email on <a href="http://www.washington.edu/pine/">Pine</a>
on a linux terminal where we chatted using <code>write(1)</code> and <code>wall(1)</code>--that taught me how Ctrl-L refreshes the screen.
I started reading newsgroups thanks to Pine, and from there, Gopher, the IRC and other text services. For many people,
the internet is the browser; for me... well, I won't lie, but email comes a close second.</p>

<p>Since the advent of RSS, I always wondered why couldn't feeds be read by email. So, long before Google Reader shut down, 
I decided to get more control over my feeds, and created some scripts
to receive them via email. 
I've been using them privately for years and, some months ago, I thought I could extend them a bit
and make a public service from them.</p>

<p>You know the drill: "I have some scripts; surely it can't be that difficult to refactor some code and
make it work for everyone". Months later, you're struggling with bugs, servers, feed providers and email clients.
Right now, it is ready to talk about it. Not yet ready to show, not yet ready to launch, but let's go step by step.</p>

<p>Personally, I love receiving RSS by email, probably because I'm a power user. Besides RSS, I've been scripting Gmail's
IMAP service to schedule incoming and outgoing mails,
and by using tags, I make items get out of the way and come back at a specific date and time. Yes, like 
<a href="http://www.boomeranggmail.com">Boomerang</a>, only some time before it existed--sorry if this sounds hipsterish, I
honestly had no idea there was a market for that.</p>

<p>My inbox is always
empty because all emails go to other folders, and a personally-crafted algorithm sorts them for me and floats
important ones back to my inbox.</p>

<p>However, I didn't have time then to create a service
around by hacky scripts anyway because of my full-time job. Nowadays I'm on a sabbatical, so I thought it could be a good
opportunity to learn how to launch and manage an online product, and maybe make a bit of much needed recurring income.</p>

<h2>Email has its advantages</h2>

<p>Even if you are not a developer, Gmail provides with smart filters that can be intelligently used to handle
incoming email. For example, when I got back from holidays I had a lot feeds waiting for me, but I deleted
old item which no longer applied with a few searches by date and source, saving a lot of time. <em>Managing emails
is a solved problem.</em></p>

<p>But probably the thing I love the most is that email is offline and always in sync. Feed readers get crazy trying
to sync their websites, smartphone apps and feed providers, but if you think about it carefully, IMAP deals with this problem
for us. Your smartphone and computer always have the same items, and thanks to push email,
always available for reading either online or offline. When you read one, it is automatically marked as read everywhere.</p>

<p>With Feenbox, I want to go one step further and provide much more metadata for email power users. For example, I'm working
on attaching all images and small files to emails, because nothing is more infuriating than receiving a feed update
where you can't read the actual comic or attached pdf document because it is only available online and 
there is a server or internet problem. With Feenbox, if you get an email, you get its contents.</p>

<p>Email has a widely known "share" feature: just forward it! Furthermore, most social websites, like Facebook and Flickr,
have an incoming email gateway, so you can post anything to Facebook just by forwarding an email. That's pretty cool,
but not many users know about that.</p>

<p>Scripting and filtering emails is so easy and powerful that I want to apply it to feed reading.</p>

<h2>Presenting feenbox</h2>

<p><a href="http://feenbox.com">feenbox</a> is currently under development, still has some bugs, but the basic multi-user features
are already implemented.</p>

<p>I want to make a dual effort, both to provide a service but also to teach users how to use their email efficiently. 
Every month there is a new post on Hacker News arguing that "we need to reinvent email", with which I usually disagree.
Email is great, but we need to make an effort to educate users on how to make the most of it. The rest can be done
with filters and IMAP scripting--and client-server programming, let's not forget the amount of work that Apple and Google are
pushing towards the authentication side, data detection and such.</p>

<p>Let's say that feeds are an excuse to learn how to filter out emails, share them and convert them to various formats.</p>

<p>Finally, I go back to the beginning of my story. Since I love using terminals, Feenbox is built with delicate text/plain
support. Right now it can convert images to ASCII art to let pine/mutt users get a quick preview of an image before opening
their browser. I also have some more ideas on the pipeline, like
the ability to automatically transform documents into text, OCR images and more. </p>

<p>I want to build a service that geeks
and hackers can fall in love with, avoiding breaking their workflow. I want to restrict to a reasonable minimum 
the amount of external tools that are needed to process
a single email, like web browsers, pdf readers, document editors, etc.</p>

<p>To summarize, feeds are a great excuse to experiment with email scripting. Besides feed handling, about 60% of the code 
are email parsers and data detectors and converters. By the way, for a guy who's been dealing with biological data for seven
years, I don't know which is more difficult to parse, a human genome or a human email!</p>

<p><img src="img/feenbox-aa.png" alt="feenbox-aa" style="centered" /></p>

<p>In a few months, it will be ready for an alpha release, and I set up a mailing list for those interested. I have currently
sent two emails, one each month, with an <a href="http://feenbox.com/list/2014-06-18">extended introduction</a> (in Spanish, but trust
Google Translator) and <a href="http://feenbox.com/list/2014-07-03">a poll with the most requested features</a>. </p>

<p>There is great communication
with the subscribers and many have emailed me their suggestions. At the moment we are about 50, which is a tiny number, 
but this is a one-man operation, and I am already learning a lot about launching a product. 
I want it to be small and friendly.</p>

<p>If you are interested in the development or may consider applying as an alpha user, please sign up. The list is handled by 
<a href="http://mailchimp.com">Mailchimp</a>, so you will get no spam and can unsubscribe at any time if you don't find it interesting.</p>

<p>Twitter&mdash;and most sites which support user comments&mdash;are filled with filth. Unfortunately, that's an indisputable
rule of the internet. Some people are just unaware of the power of their words, and
write comments that expose the worst of human nature, like the guy who 
<a href="http://elpais.com/elpais/2014/05/16/inenglish/1400232016_588758.html">cheered the murder of a Spanish politician</a></p>

<p>Despicable as that comment is, however, I think that police resources would be better used if going after actual criminals
or corrupt politicians instead of angry teenagers. On the other hand, people should start learning that throwing bile
on internet comments <a href="http://www.elmundo.es/elmundo/2013/06/14/espana/1371230608.html">may be freedom of speech</a> but also an offence of verbal threatening. Let's just start behaving
like intelligent people and try neither to threaten others nor indict dumb twitter users.</p>

<p>My point here is that 
the internet was born free, and it is now turning into a "regular" business: <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7750036">money will pay quality of service</a>,
<a href="http://elpais.com/elpais/2014/02/14/inenglish/1392391558_174426.html">online media will be regulated</a> as if hyperlinks and news excerpts were copyright infringement, and now all 
internet comments will be treated as if they were uttered on the real world; at the main street or on a news outlet.</p>

<p>That is not necessarily bad, <em>per se</em>. However, the people and lobbies regulating the net are the same people who 
<a href="http://cfenollosa.com/blog/the-ignorant-eu-cookie-law.html">think cookies are a menace to user privacy</a> and have strong political and economical interests on putting strong
leashes to users. The internet has been bypassing their establishment for about 20 years and now it's time to put an end to that.</p>

<p>Should the internet be different from the rest of society? It's not a rhetorical question. However, there is no easy answer.
The net has created new idiosyncrasies and, if we change the rules of the game, more things need to change. However, politicians
don't understand&mdash;or don't want to&mdash;this concept. </p>

<p>If they charge business for their QoS, then those business must be able to demand public internet providers 
where there are monopolies
or oligopolies. If a blog can be sued for copyright infringement, so must be TVs that feed from youtube users. The list goes on.</p>

<p>The problem now is that it's too tempting for the establishment to regulate everything in their favor. And, given that they
have the ability to do so, puts democracy to shame. That is, <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/blogs-echochambers-27074746">if there is one</a>.</p>

<p>As incredible as it sounds, the tinfoil-hat people were actually right. 
What's more indignant, teenagers may pay large fines for hate speech while governments steal their naked pictures from their 
webcams and companies take our tax money to turn it against our interests. </p>

<p>Regrettably, for those who didn't know it, that is how
the world has always worked. The internet was a small oasis that lasted a few years and gave us a taste of real freedom,
for the good and the bad&mdash;Silk Road, CP, etc.</p>

<p>What now? I think we should support organizations that <a href="https://www.eff.org">defend our rights</a>, 
<a href="https://www.torproject.org">software that empowers us</a> instead of relying on the <em>bona fide</em> of our providers, and helping develop <a href="https://freenetproject.org">a new internet</a>,
if that were the case.</p>

<p>In Spain, we have a saying "hecha la ley, hecha la trampa". It means that the cheaters will always be one step ahead of the rules.
Applied to the internet, that will be a good thing for users and freedom.</p>

<h3><a class="ablack" href="the-ignorant-eu-cookie-law.html">
The ignorant EU cookie law
</a></h3>
<!-- bashblog_timestamp: #201403181829.00# -->
<div class="subtitle">March 18, 2014 &mdash; 
Carlos Fenollosa

<!-- text begin -->

<p>It is 2014, and many webmasters still don't know that there is <a href="http://ico.org.uk/for_organisations/privacy_and_electronic_communications/the_guide/cookies">a new EU law</a> which regulates cookies
and other data stored in user computers. This is part of a noble effort to protect user privacy, which, well,
I personally support. </p>

<p>Unfortunately, <strong>the actual law is technically incompetent and does nothing for
user privacy</strong> while placing a lot of responsibility on webmasters and costing them a lot of time and money.</p>

<p>Put it another way, this law wants to protect users by forcing spoon merchants to inform clients about the 
chance of being harmed by a spoon while ignoring knife, drug or gun merchants. It's useless.</p>

<p>This uselessness and absolute ignorance of how the Internet works is costing EU webmasters a lot of time
and money. In my case, I counted them, about ten hours. For large companies, it
can be a lot more.</p>

<p>Why am I against this law? Why do I say it is useless? </p>

<h4>It doesn't protect user privacy</h4>

<p>Cookies are not the only way to track us. 
Modern methods use just Javascript (i.e. the Facebook 'like' button) and leave no data on the user's browser.</p>

<p>Furthermore, the browser itself can be used to uniquely identify you. <a href="https://panopticlick.eff.org">Test it</a></p>

<p>What's worse, it says nothing about doing analytics with personal data, like the IP. </p>

<p>And how could we forget the fact that it is the governments themselves <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/feb/27/gchq-nsa-webcam-images-internet-yahoo">who are spying on users</a>? 
How on Earth need cookies legislation if the UK and US just steal pictures from our webcams, data from
our emails and information from our text messages?</p>

<p>Our legislators must be absolutely ignorant or absolute hypocrites to regulate cookies while governments spy on us.
I'm not sure which one is worse.</p>

<h4>Cookie management was solved 20 years ago</h4>

<p>Let's assume that the previous reason wasn't valid. Let's assume cookies were a real menace to user privacy.</p>

<p>Well, this problem was solved since IE4, when browsers invented the cookie warning popup window.</p>

<p>Managing cookies in the browser is the best idea, for many reasons:</p>

<ul>
<li>It is a central tool to manage cookies.</li>
<li>Display a common interface for all cookie warnings. With the current law, every webpage displays the
notification with a different style and location: on top, on the bottom, on a side, on a popup. Visitors don't
know where to find it.</li>
<li>We should trust user software instead of website policies. What if a website was using cookies
to track me? Should I trust them? Would it solve anything that they had to pay a fine if they have already
stolen my data? Concerned people should use trusted browsers, and hardened open-source operating systems, 
if possible. To state an example, Facebook would earn more money by breaking this law and spying on us with cookies
than the fine it would have to pay if they get caught.</li>
</ul>

<h4>It confuses users</h4>

<p>I did a quick survey with some non-technical people, asking them if they had seen this "cookies notice".
They said they had. I then asked them if they did understand what it meant. They didn't. </p>

<p>Modern UXs have overwhelmed us with notification windows, up to a point that we just click on "dismiss" without
even looking at them. Well, we should read the text, but the truth is that many people don't. Instead of arguing
over what should be done, let's try to avoid contributing to the too-many-notifications problem, and just
solve them on the browser.</p>

<p>By the way, I bet that the most clicked button on IE6 was the "Accept all cookies, do not bother me again" checkbox.</p>

<h4>It costs people a lot of pain and money</h4>

<p>Let's imagine there are a million websites in the EU. Let's imagine every webmaster takes, in average, 8 hours
to adapt each to the new cookie laws. Let's imagine the average webmaster cost is 50&euro;/hr</p>

<p>This useless law has costed EU companies and individuals 400 million euros. Nice way to impulse the internet economy.</p>

<h4>Different countries have different requirements</h4>

<p>In the UK, it is enough to provide a notice to tell users that the website uses cookies. </p>

<p>About ten years ago,
browser developers decided to remove the UX label that notified the user when cookies were received because
they thought there was not much to show. Now we have to implement them again, <em>on a per-site basis</em>. Outstanding, given that
the cookie is set anyway.</p>

<p>Bad as it is, in Spain, a website can't set cookies unless the user accepts them, either by 
scrolling or clicking a link. At least, well, the user is "protected" by default, even though the 
technical solution is harder.</p>

<h4>Helping the community</h4>

<p>Angry as I am right now for having wasted ten hours of my life implementing a useless law, I thought
the least I could do, besides writing a rage post, was to share my solution.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/cfenollosa/eu-cookie-law">You can go to Github</a> and download the sample I prepared. It's the same code that you can see running here 
if you noticed the banner. It might not be the best, but at least it gives webmasters a starting idea, 
and no-PHP, 100% HTML+javascript routine to run all Analytics and cookie-dependent code.</p>

<p>To summarize my implementation, it consists of a javascript file which handles the cookie banner, sets the actual
cookie when the user gives consent, and also manages some exceptions. Unlike most of the solutions I found, which
only display the banner, this code does actually handle cookies.</p>

<p>Check it out, and please, feel free to send pull requests and discuss its issues.</p>

<h4>Final thoughts</h4>

<p>I think my points are quite valid, and this is actually a useless and annoying law that serves nothing
and costs money. If the regulators had consulted a competent panel, they would have learned that the cookie law
does not serve their noble intention of protecting users.</p>

<p>The root problem, again, is that our politicians don't have the slightest idea of how the internet works. These are
the same guys that <a href="http://savetheinternet.eu">now must decide on the fate of the internet as we know it</a>.</p>

<p>I don't know about you, but I lost all my hopes long ago.</p>
