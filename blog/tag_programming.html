<p><a href="http://elixir-lang.org">Elixir</a> is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elixir_(programming_language)">fairly young</a> language that was born when <a href="https://github.com/josevalim">José and a few Rails developers</a>
tried to create a modern language optimized for concurrent, distributed, lightweight processes</p>

<p>They wanted a modern Ruby-like syntax with a well-tested process manager, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erlang_(programming_language)">Erlang VM</a>.
The result is Elixir, defined as <em>a dynamic, functional language designed for building scalable and maintainable applications</em>,
a correct but vague affirmation which doesn't do justice to its power and elegancy.</p>

<p>I recently <a href="https://lobste.rs/s/pej1vc/moving_away_from_python_2/comments/1txpzt#c_1txpzt">compared</a> the move to Elixir from Python as a similar leapfrog to
moving to Python from Java. It feels like something new, modern, powerful, with killer features that you don't want to
renounce to. </p>

<p>In Python I found a REPL, list comprehensions, a super clean syntax and decorators. Elixir brings lightweight supervised
processes, pattern matching, a fully functional programming language, pipes and a terrific build tool: <code>mix</code></p>

<p>If you've never written functional code, the jump is significant. I took a <a href="https://www.coursera.org/course/progfun">Scala course</a> a couple years ago
and I've needed almost two full weeks to write production code in Elixir. The language is young, Stack Overflow is of no help
&mdash;no kidding, that is a big deal&mdash;, and there are few libraries in Github.</p>

<p>A small community also comes with some upsides: people are more motivated and willing to help, centralized tools like forums
and IRC channels are still manageable, and you may even suggest changes to the language for upcoming versions.</p>

<h4>What is Elixir for?</h4>

<p>I had a middle school teacher who said that you can't define something by stating <em>what is't not</em>. However, in programming,
mentioning use cases which are not suitable for the language is a good way to start.</p>

<p>Elixir is probably not the first choice for single core software: math calculus, CPU-intensive apps or desktop applications. 
Since it's very high level, systems programming is also out of the picture.</p>

<p>Elixir is great for web applications, standalone or using the <a href="http://www.phoenixframework.org">Phoenix framework</a> &mdash;Elixir's Rails&mdash;. 
It really shines for building highly scalable, fault-tolerant network applications, like chats, telecommunications or
generic web services.</p>

<p>Why is that? Thanks to the Erlang VM, processes are really tiny, each one is garbage collected with a low latency,
they communicate by sending location-independent messages over the network using the VMs 
(you can run <code>result = Machine2.Module.function(params)</code> on Machine1),
and spawning and managing these processes is effortless thanks to some of its abstractions.</p>

<p>Finally, Elixir's basic modules also shine: <code>Plug</code> and <code>Router</code> for managing HTTP requests, <code>Ecto</code> for relational databases and
<code>ETS</code> and <code>Mnesia</code> for distributed in-memory databases. </p>

<p>Many recommend Elixir if only for Phoenix, but I found that for most backend applications it is enough to use <code>Plug</code> and <code>Router</code>.
Phoenix is impressive but I believe it's a mistake to jump right into it without trying the base modules first, so my recommendation for 
beginners is to hold on Phoenix until you really need it.</p>

<p>Elixir's novelty, the pipe operator, is a fantastic approach to working with state in a functional manner. Instead of running 
<code>readlines(fopen(user_input(), "r")).uppercase().split()</code>, try the more readable <code>user_input |&gt; fopen("r") |&gt; readlines |&gt; uppercase |&gt; split</code>.</p>

<p>It is a language which was clearly designed to stand on the shoulders of giants, while providing modern capabilities
for developers.</p>

<h4>Elixir's abstractions</h4>

<p>To store centralized &lt;key, value&gt;-like data, instead of a Singleton, 
Elixir's provides an <code>Agent</code>. It keeps state in memory and many processes can access and modify it without concurrency issues.</p>

<p>The language can spawn processes much like threads, using <code>spawn_link</code>, but you probably don't want to do that. You'd
rather use a <code>Task</code>, which is basically <code>async/await</code>, or a <code>Gen(eric)Server</code>, a very cool abstraction that receives requests
from other processes, spawns helper mini-servers and processes the results in parallel, for free.</p>

<p>All tasks can be controlled using the <code>Supervisor</code>, which holds other abstractions as its "children" and automatically restarts
them when they crash.</p>

<p>Finally, your code is contained inside a single <code>project</code> which can manage different <code>apps</code>, with modules that hold functions. 
No packages, no classes, no objects. Modules, functions, structs and basic data types.</p>

<p>Dependency management is
straightforward thanks to <code>mix</code>; builds and testing are handled by <code>mix</code> too. As opposed to other multi-tools like <code>gradle</code>, this
one is really fast.</p>

<p>Is that too much to process? I felt that at first, too. Give it some time and your brain will eventually think in terms of
<code>Supervisor</code>s which manage <code>GenServer</code>s which spawn <code>Agent</code>s and <code>Task</code>s when needed.</p>

<h4>Let it crash</h4>

<p>Elixir's mantra is to let processes crash. I found it shocking and counter-intuitive, but with some explanation it makes a lot of sense.</p>

<p>Neither developers want their code to crash nor Elixir promotes writing bad code. 
However, let's agree that there are
many reasons besides bad programming which can make a software crash. 
If we have a server which runs stuff and at some point we have, say, 100 connections every second, one might crash eventually
because of a bug in any component, hardware issues, a cosmic ray, or Murphy's law.</p>

<p>The question is: in the event of an unfortunate, unavoidable crash, how will your system react?</p>

<ol>
<li>Bring everything down?</li>
<li>Try to capture the error and recover?</li>
<li>Kill the crashed process and launch another one in its place?</li>
</ol>

<p>For example, C uses approach 1. Most modern languages with Exceptions like Java and Python use 2. 
Elixir uses 3. This is not suitable for all environments, but it is
perfect for those use cases which fit Elixir: concurrent network processes.</p>

<p>With Elixir, a single failure never brings the system down. What's more, it automatically restarts the crashed process, so the 
client can instantly retry and, unless there is a reproducible bug in your code, the fresh process will finish without an issue.</p>

<p>The bottom line is: a single client may be unlucky and crash at some point, but the rest of the system will never notice.</p>

<h4>How to start?</h4>

<p>Let's get our hands dirty. After reading many sites, watching hours of video and following a dozen tutorials, here are the resources
I found the most valuable. I'd suggest following this order.</p>

<p><strong>Getting started</strong></p>

<ol>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZV4_uNw72A">Madrid Elixir Meetup 2016-03</a>. If you understand Spanish, this is the best intro to Elixir. Otherwise, watch 
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kYmOyJjGDM">All aboard the Elixir Express!</a> which is a bit outdated but very comprehensive.</li>
<li><a href="http://elixir-lang.org/getting-started/introduction.html">Official "Getting Started" guide</a>. It's the best and the most current. Follow it from start to finish, including the 
advanced chapters.</li>
<li><a href="https://elixirschool.com">Elixir School</a>. A nice complement to the official guide. Most things are very similar, but the different approach
on OTP will help you understand it better.</li>
<li><a href="https://medium.com/@StevenLeiva1/understanding-elixir-s-genserver-a8d5756e6848#.a2yytqrbe">Understanding Elixir's GenServer</a> and <a href="https://medium.com/@StevenLeiva1/elixir-supervisors-a-conceptual-understanding-ee0825f70cbe#.zbyjhdg0u">Elixir's supervisors, a conceptual understanding</a> are two short reads
with yet another explanation of OTP features.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/lr1t87rw4wfnyb3/elixir-cheat-sheet-v2.pdf?dl=0">Elixir Cheat Sheet</a>. The best one out there</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>First projects</strong></p>

<ol>
<li><a href="https://github.com/gregpardo/vim-elixir-ide">vim-elixir-ide</a>. Elixir support for <code>vim</code>, not the best plugin but suitable for beginners.</li>
<li><a href="https://elixir-examples.github.io">Elixir examples</a>. The Elixir guide covers all these, but it's handy to have common idioms on a single page: "string to list", "concatenate list", "optional function parameters", etc.</li>
<li><a href="http://howistart.org/posts/elixir/1">Portal Game by José Valim</a>. A complement to the sample project on the official guide.</li>
<li><a href="http://elixirkoans.io">Elixir Koans</a> and <a href="http://exercism.io/languages/elixir">Exercism</a> are mini exercises that you can use to improve your Elixir agility. On the same line,
<a href="http://elixirgolf.com">Elixir Golf</a> proposes weekly puzzles to solve.</li>
<li><a href="http://learningelixir.joekain.com">Learning Elixir</a>. Joseph Kain has a ton of content with mini projects and examples you can follow. Top quality. </li>
<li><a href="https://excasts.com/episodes">Excasts</a> and <a href="http://elixirsips.com/">Elixir sips</a> have short screencasts that you can check out for reference</li>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLWbHc_FXPo2gB7HUE-2H61HAEyszAph3H">ElixirConf videos</a> contain very interesting talks which may be overwhelming for beginners, but are worth
a look later on.</li>
<li><a href="https://gist.github.com/likethesky/abb00e5aedc38ee9f711">Install Elixir and Phoenix on OSX</a>. If you want to use Phoenix on OSX, you may need this help</li>
<li><a href="http://www.phoenixframework.org/docs/overview">Phoenix Official Guide</a>. Phoenix isn't necessary for simple web services, you can use <code>Plug</code>. But for 
large projects you'll need a framework. Nothing like the official guide.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Getting help</strong></p>

<ol>
<li><a href="https://github.com/h4cc/awesome-elixir">Awesome Elixir</a>. A list of Elixir resources, where I found many of these.</li>
<li><a href="https://twitter.com/ElixirTip">Elixir Tip</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/elixirstatus">Elixir Status</a> regularly link to Elixir-related articles and videos, and 
<a href="http://blog.plataformatec.com.br/tag/elixir/">Plataformatec Elixir posts</a> is where the language authors share news and tips.</li>
<li>If you have questions about code, try the <a href="http://elixirforum.com">Elixir forum</a> first, the <a href="irc://irc.freenode.net/elixir-lang">IRC channel</a>
or <a href="https://elixir-slackin.herokuapp.com/">Slack</a>. The developers would like to transition all help requests out of the <a href="https://groups.google.com/group/elixir-lang-talk">Mailing list</a>,
which you can use for language-related discussions.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/elixir">/r/elixir</a> if you're into Reddit</li>
</ol>

<h4>Closing thoughts</h4>

<p>I think that's all for the moment. I hope this post can help some beginners to get their hands on the language and start
writing production code as soon as possible. </p>

<p>For anyone who wants to know what's all the Elixir fuss about, it's difficult to explain, especially for somebody like me
who has been programming in imperative languages all his life.</p>

<p>When I recommended Elixir to a friend, he replied, "A highly concurrent, functional language using the Erlang VM? 
Don't you have something more exotic?". That's right. Elixir is exotic and use-case specific. </p>

<p>Unlike Python, which is my favorite imperative language and ecosystem, I can't recommend Elixir for everyone.
Not everybody can spare a couple weeks to get started. Many libraries for common use cases are missing: 
there is nothing
equivalent to Numpy or Matplotlib, and modern
applications are built on top of dozens of libs, not everyone has the time or will to write library code.
Fortunately, at <a href="http://paradoxa.io">Paradoxa</a> I am my own boss and I make the tech decisions :)</p>

<p>For hackers or tinkerers it's definitely worth a look, it "won't change your perspective" like Lisp, but
it will make you see that writing concurrent code doesn't need to be difficult, and that better tooling is definitely possible.</p>

<p>I bet Elixir will be the foundation of most devops stacks in a few years, when developers realize that the 
future's bottleneck won't be the CPU, but rather the number of concurrent processes and connections your backend can manage.
With Elixir you only need to boot another machine in your network and let the exotic Erlang VM handle the rest.</p>

<p>Us programmers like to customize our programming environment to the maximum. If arguing about text editors
and <a href="/blog/unix-tricks-you-should-be-using.html">customizing your .bashrc</a> weren't enough,
we also <a href="/blog/hacking-your-keyboard.html">modify a 20 year old Apple Extended II keyboard</a> to change its
keyswitch tone, <a href="/blog/redefining-your-keyboard.html">remap our keyboard layout</a>
to redefine the CapsLock key, and of course
<a href="/blog/which-is-the-best-programming-language.html">decide on which programming language to use</a>
for our projects.</p>

<p>For those who really like customization, however, there are more aspects to it. One of those is, of course,
<a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/39wz4l/hey_reddit_developers_what_is_your_favorite_text/">the programming font choice</a>.
Leaving aside the fact that unless you're using a monospaced font you're a monster, some people like
the classics, like Courier (New), others use the default ones, and some of us really like the retro visuals
and opt for one of the nostalgic typefaces.</p>

<p>My favorite one is <a href="http://www.viste-family.net/mateusz/dos/en/dosega.htm">DOS/EGA</a>, by Mateusz Viste.
Just make sure that your text editor supports rendering typefaces without anti aliasing and that you
don't need many non-ASCII characters. Most are implemented but some editors screw either the line size or
the kerning and make text look very ugly.</p>

<p>There are other versions of the same font, but Mateusz's is the best one and has the least annoyances.</p>

<p>I don't use it everywhere because of rendering problems with some IDEs, 
but OSX's terminal seems to handle them
well, and it plays perfectly with a black background. Truly retro but, I think, 
an excellent programming font.</p>

<p>As an engineer, I enjoy fixing things, 
disassembling gear and learning how it works. I'm sure many of you opened watches, pens or other
small electronics as a child, only to find that there is "that extra piece" after reassembling them.</p>

<p>My grandfather was an artisan, and I still have some of his pieces. They are sensational
and reflect not only the image he was trying to create, but also his general mood, recognizable by
observing the strokes, edges and paths that the gouges followed. That's why I prefer looking at an 
artist's collection rather than a compilation, 
it's easy and shocking how they&mdash;and their environment&mdash;evolve over time by looking at their works.</p>

<p>For me, however, fixing a Game Boy does not resemble creating a beautiful sculpture from a piece of
wood. Basically, I've never had the manual ability nor
the tools to build real-world things from scratch, and that's a skill I envy. Fixing or improving existing
things <em>&agrave; la</em> McGyver is one thing, but producing something from scratch is an entirely different expertise.
That's why I love looking at other people's projects at the <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/diy">DIY subreddit</a>. </p>

<p>But, in some way, programmers are DIY masters, especially for small weekend projects meant to scratch an itch. 
In the zeros and ones
world, crafting can mean writing a script to automatically parse gmail for youtube links you send to yourself
from your cell phone, downloading them in the background, converting them to mp4 and saving them into iTunes,
so that they automatically get pushed to your iPad and are ready to watch when at home.</p>

<p>Not only the result may be notable, it also carries a little bit of
yourself in the code. Which language did you use? Did you feel lazy and wrote it in Bash, or wanted it
to be robust and wrote some Python? Is it all on a single function or split into modules? How did you
name the variables? Are there comments and documentation or is it a quick hack?</p>

<p>Comparing code to other art forms is a clich&eacute;, granted. But when I look at my <code>/usr/local/bin/</code> folder,
I don't only see some scripts, I also see my own evolution regarding programming languages, project ideas,
organization, skill, and why not, my attitude.</p>

<p>Ah! I see that around 2011 I stopped using backticks in Bash scripts and replaced them with 
command substitution. Then in 2012 Python scripts start replacing Bash. Around that time I learned Git, 
because I can see a lot of helper scripts there. I guess I didn't like it
back then since I see a lot of "wtf" comments.</p>

<p>There are some unfinished projects. I know because the files aren't executable. Upon opening them, yes,
the code is only half written. Will I pick them up someday? I really don't know, but I love remembering
that three years ago I was working on an audio synchronization project. I had completely forgotten.</p>

<p>A programmer won't likely get his code displayed at an art gallery, it probably wouldn't even make sense
except for a few other programmers. But observing the evolution of your work 
is a good self-reflection exercise. Reading other people's code is probably a must, but reading your own,
even if it makes you cringe a bit&mdash;God, was I really using Hungarian notation?&mdash; will let
you see how far you've come. It's like looking at that famous <a href="http://blog.codinghorror.com/microsoft-1978/">Microsoft staff in 1978</a> picture. A bit shameful, but necessary to let us all remember
that even Bill Gates worked his way up from the bottom.</p>

<p>Take some time to look at your crafts from some years ago, and take pride in them. They may not be a 
beautiful table or lamp, but they treasure a little bit of yourself from the past.</p>

<p>Maybe the difference between a junior and a senior programmer is that the first will sometimes
say "I don't know how to do this", while the second will always say "Give me a week".</p>

<p>When you finish college with a computer engineering degree, everything seems possible.
You just learned how to design a computer from the zeros and ones up to the applications.
From logic gates up to a CPU, from TCP to HTTP, from assembler to Java.</p>

<p>Then, time passes, you get a regular job, and regardless of its awesomeness you start forgetting stuff. Furthermore, you discover super smart
people who are light years ahead of you, and for some reason, your mind thinks of them
as superheroes, almost magical creatures who can <a href="http://wiki.qemu.org/Main_Page">write an ultrafast x86 emulator</a>
or <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yHJOz_y9rZE">make a 
disk drive play the Imperial March</a></p>

<p>Don't get me wrong, these are amazing feats. But psychologically you start to feel
dumber and dumber up to the point where you believe that the only thing you can aspire to
is write webpages and some normal stuff. Even if you have great skills and do a great job
at a great company, it's difficult not to feel just a tiny peg of the machine.</p>

<p>I didn't know how to do anything else, and I thought I'd fail if I tried. In college, I suffered
a lot with some courses, and to date I still don't know how I passed. But the truth is that
college is very dense, and without all the stress from exams and projects, and thanks to
age and experience, things actually get easier to learn.</p>

<p>That's why side projects are important.</p>

<p>Three years ago I launched my first successful project to the Internet, <a href="http://cfenollosa.com/blog/creating-a-simple-blog-system-with-a-500-line-bash-script.html">bashblog</a>.
It's no big deal, but it's a commitment. People use it, contribute patches, discuss ideas, and I have the responsibility
to make it work.</p>

<p>Then I started learning things that have always tickled my curiosity. It started with
<a href="https://class.coursera.org/progfun-002">functional programming</a>, one of the academic topics
which has been discussed since the 60s but never took off. Then I did more courses on astrophysics
and statistics. </p>

<p>This year I left my job to take a sabbatical and start new projects. In some countries it's normal
to take a sabbatical before starting college to travel and learn. But almost nobody thinks about
a sabbatical when you're 30. You can choose a wrong career path when you're 18 and fix it, but the
30s are critical and one needs to be really sure that they want to spend the rest of their life
doing what they love.</p>

<p>I have recently found, don't know how to put it, some change of mind, new strength, inspiration.
<a href="https://github.com/cfenollosa/os-tutorial">I want to learn how to write an OS</a>. I started writing
mobile apps. I want to <a href="http://feenbox.com">launch a product</a>. I'm contributing to an industrial patent
to do really cool stuff with cellphones.</p>

<p>As usual, every of these projects hides many challenges. I've had to read RFCs,
learn how to extract voice patterns from an audio file, write device drivers, deal with lawyers and read
formal documents <sup>1</sup></p>

<p>We live in the information age. There are plenty of resources, some of those <a href="http://cfenollosa.com/blog/learn-new-stuff-online-for-free.html">University-grade</a>,
to learn new skills. <a href="http://cfenollosa.com/blog/tips-to-work-from-home.html">Discipline and planning</a> can go a long way.
There is no excuse.</p>

<p>Github and other websites have also made it effortless to collaborate with total strangers. It really makes me
happy and proud to see other people commenting on things I've done. Years ago you had to go to a computer
hobbyist meeting to show your work, now you can do it online... and others will improve it. </p>

<p>Stack Overflow will provide code samples and guidance. I've now
started hearing undergrads utter "Did you really code programs without Stack Overflow?" in the same way
that I used to say "Did you code programs without the internet?" to people who had to read manuals and go to
a library.</p>

<p>Hacker News and Reddit can guide you on what's cool nowadays. 
<a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/startupideas.html">Live in the future, then build what's missing</a>.</p>

<p>I guess that it's comfortable to dismiss some ideas just because "we don't know how to do it".
And that's a waste of our university degrees. We have some responsibility to do cool stuff.
If we don't build it, who will? If we can build it, why wait? If you don't have the skills,
learn them. Just Google it. Work on it for a week, and you will succeed.</p>

<p>Do you miss the adrenaline rush that you used to get when you first discovered something?
The "oooh" and the "aaah"? Learn something new, something radical, something cool and futuristic.
Start a project, and release it. It doesn't need to be complete.</p>

<p>The greatest force that pushes us to build things is the knowledge that nobody else will build them for us.</p>

<p>~~~~~</p>

<p>[1] One of the multiple things that managers usually do and engineers don't appreciate enough</p>

SQLite: a standalone database for your application

<p>Us researchers are used to store data in plain text formats, because it's very
easy to parse and work with. While this is appropriate for some data types&mdash;and,
I'd add, very useful to send later to <tt>R</tt>&mdash;, in some cases disk access is slow or just
inefficient.</p>

<p>This topic is actually very important for some projects, as storing records into a plain text file
is very slow to <i>query</i> afterwards. And this is the key question to ask ourselves before considering
to use a database. Databases are great for complex, unordered queries, but not so great for sequential
access of raw data. Let's see an example.</p>

<p>There is a data file which stores atom coordinates, for example, from a Molecular Dynamics simulation.
This data is very likely to be read once, sequentially, then processed in memory. The information
represents a matrix which will be processed by mathematic functions.
This is the classic example where data files (either binary of plain text) are used correctly.</p>

<p>But now let's think of a list of proteins and some properties, for example, molecular weight
and number of available 3D structures. All these objects are independent, they have their own entity.
While you can store a text file with one line per <tt>&lt;protein, weight, structures&gt;</tt>, it makes
more sense to store it on a database.</p>

<p>Databases allow complex queries to be resolved very quickly. For example,
<i>give me all proteins with molecular weight > 50,000 </i>, <i>list
all proteins which have no crystal structures</i>, or <i>print all the proteins
which have duplicate structures</i>. Were we working with a text file, we would need to process it
completely every time we perform
a query. That's very, very slow. Databases internally store the information in such a way that queries
don't need to go through all elements to get the answer. Namely, they store data on trees by indices.</p>

<p>How do indices work? It's a complex issue but let's think of a very basic example.
Let's say you have three protein structures
<tt>(1BCD, 2KI5, 1AGI)</tt> which you want to index by name and molecular weight.
The system will then automatically build
a protein binary tree where <tt>1BCD</tt> is the parent, the left child is <tt>1AGI</tt> and
<tt>2KI5</tt> is the right child. Then, it will create another tree where the left child is
the lightest protein, the parent is the middle one, and the right child is the heaviest one.</p>

<p>If the index tree is always sorted where the left child is alphabetically
inferior than the parent, and the right child is always superior to the parent, then we can access any
element or group of elements not only without checking every item but also in logarithmic time.
Databases do this once for every index you configure, so complex queries can be solved super fast
because for each of them the system only needs to process a few items of the many millions you might
have stored in the DB. That's because every time you jump to a child element, the system
is avoiding to process half of the database, then a half of this half (1/4), then 1/8, etc.</p>

<p>To summarize, if you have some data where each record has its own entity (i.e. can be thought of
as an "object") and you think you'll make queries which retrieve an arbitrary number of the
elements, then you need to use a database. Databases have even more advantages, like relationships
between objects (e.g. each crystal structure has its own entity, and can be related to a protein), but
database design is a complex topic and this article will cover only the basic data storage.</p>

<p>However, databases are usually configured by the system administrator and
handled by a daemon&mdash;<tt>oracle</tt>, <tt>mysql</tt>, <tt>postgresql</tt>. Here I will talk about
yet another way of creating databases, without the need to start any daemons, have any user privileges
and, more importantly, easily portable. This is done via <tt>sqlite</tt>.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sqlite.org/index.html">SQLite</a>
is a library that implements a SQL engine inside your own application. This means that while
the database is persistent inside a file, all the querying infrastructure is deployed along with your
code and stopped when the code finishes running. The databases can be created very easily, making it
easy to have multiple DBs for testing, and without the need to bother the system administrator.</p>

<p><tt>sqlite</tt> has bindings for almost all popular languages and also a commandline interface
which is handy for testing and debugging. The data is stored on a single file which can be deployed
with your application without needing to install any standalone servers. Obviously, it is not a
replacement for Oracle's solutions, but it can speed up a lot some applications which need to work
querying data and don't have access to one.</p>

<p>Most popular software uses some kind of database to store data, as this is a super fast way to
access preferences and other items. For scientific programs, it is always necessary
to think twice before using one, as database design is an art on its own, and as said before,
it does not suit all needs.</p>

<p>When used properly, a small ad-hoc database like <tt>sqlite</tt> can speed up
software, make data access very easy and allow the manipulation of large, objectified,
in-related data collections with simple queries instead of writing long and slow algorithms
which process all the data when you only need one item.</p>

Which is the best programming language?

<p>This classic question from beginners who start coding their own tools for research has only one
correct answer: <b>it depends</b>.</p>

<p>If there is no language which is clearly better than the others, why do I have this very
simple table on my <a href="http://mmb.pcb.ub.es/~carlesfe/#unix">Unix section?</a>

<ol>
<li>Bash, awk are your first choice</li>
<li>PHP if you require more power</li>
<li>C only if you know why</li>
<li>Use Java &amp; Eclipse</li>
</ol>

<p>Don't get me wrong, this table has been compiled from quite a few years of experience, and there are
huge assumptions behind it. The first one is that you still don't know what language you should use. If there
is no doubt, either because there are some requirements for the project or because there is a language that is
designed specifically for that task (e.g. <code>CLIPS</code> for declarative programming), then you need to
ask yourself some questions.</p>

<p>I'll start by enumerating the most popular language choices and some of their features</p>


<h4>Scripting languages</h4>

<p>Scripting languages are good for small or medium projects, because they fit very well with the
line of thought of the programmer. This means you can program while you think, which isn't the best for
cleanliness, but it gets the work done quickly</p>

<ul>
<li><code><b>bash</b></code> is always your first choice. You already know how to run stuff in the command
line, right? So this is basically the same. <code>bash</code> can handle functions and arrays, but that's
pretty much all it can do. However, that's usually good enough for small routines, and you can
always call other Unix tools. It also avoids the overhead of running another binary (<code>perl</code>,
<code>php</code>) as it is already in memory.</li>

<li><code><b>perl</b></code> is great to parse text, but slow for anything else. If you need to parse
text <b>and</b> do math, use <code>php</code>, which has a faster math engine. It also lacks objects.
However, there are very
good scientific libraries for it, so you might be forced to use this language anyway.</li>

<li><code><b>php</b></code> has nice libraries to connect to databases and in general do web stuff. It is
also object oriented, so it is a suitable candidate for small-medium projects which can benefit from
object orientation but don't need all the infrastructure from <code>java</code> or <code>C++</code>. In general,
unless you are tied to <code>perl</code>, <code>php</code> is a better choice.</li>

<li><code><b>python</b></code> is, well, another scripting language. It's way better than <code>perl</code>, and
functionally similar to <code>php</code>, so you might want to use it if you like its clean syntax or
need to call other <code>python</code> libraries.<br/>
<i>Edit: after having used python for a long time, it is the first language I'd recommend for most
use cases</i>
</li>

<li><code><b>ruby</b></code> is so painfully slow that you should avoid it at any costs. I am including it
here only to warn other people against using it.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Compiled languages</h4>

<p>Once you start compiling code, things get complicated. However, the results are usually great, fast,
and very maintainable. Let's discuss the alternatives.</p>

<ul>
<li><code><b>java</b></code> why <code>java</code> first? Because it's the most appropriate. It has great
developing tools (Eclipse), it checks a lot of stuff in compile time, it does not
need that the programmer uses pointers&mdash;it uses pointers internally, but transparently&mdash;and
in general is a modern, object-oriented language, which doesn't require legacy stuff like headers. Yes,
it is a bit slower than pure <code>C</code>, but the latest versions of the java virtual machine
compile to machine code on runtime and achieve great performance. Most computer scientists have
mastered it and in general it is widely extended. It is versatile and can be used from simple routines
to implement web pages with <code>JSP</code>, to CRMs. Yes, I like <code>java</code>.</li>

<li><code><b>C</b></code> is the mother of all programming languages, but this does not mean that it's the
best one. It's old, doesn't have objects, and for every byte optimization which earns 1 second of
execution time, the programmer needs to waste ten minutes. Optimizations should be done at the compiler
level, not the code level. However, <code>C</code> has great compilers, from the good-enough <code>gcc</code>
to the awesome <code>icc</code>. <br/>
My recommendation is that you use it only if you know what you're doing. It's
awful to parse strings in <code>C</code>, it lacks many scientific libraries compared to
<code>perl</code> or <code>java</code>&mdash;except math functions, but that's what <code>R</code> is for&mdash;and
the segmentation faults in general can make you waste several days
looking into the code because you declared a variable incorrectly and you have a pagination issue.<br/>
Some might argue that <code>C</code> is as good as the programmer is, but honestly, it makes good
programmers waste a lot of time because of small issues.</li>

<li><code><b>C++</b></code> is the alternative if you need to use <code>C</code> in an object-oriented
environment. The compiler is also able to run more checks in compile time, so you'll waste less time,
but I'd go for <code>java</code> anyway. There is no reason to choose <code>C++</code> a priori but execution
speed</li>

<li><code><b>objective-C</b></code> Apple users are sometimes tempted to write <code>obj-C</code> code, because
of the excellent development tools on a Mac, but keep in mind that probably there is nobody else
who can look at that code afterwards and understand it, because almost nobody uses <code>obj-C</code>.
So I'd suggest not to use it unless you're in a hardcore Mac environment or are planning to develop
a GUI for a Mac afterwards.</li>

<li><code><b>fortran</b></code> there are only two kinds of people who use <code>fortran</code>: physicists
and the poor fellows who have to maintain their code afterwards. It was designed for the 50s computers,
which means that using it nowadays would be like using steering wheels from John Ford on today's cars.
It is easier to understand <code>f2c</code> generated code than the original one. There is not a single
reason to use
<code>fortran</code>. If you need raw speed use <code>C</code>. If you want to write unmaintainable code,
well, use obfuscated <code>perl</code>.</li>
</ul>


<h4>Choosing a language</h4>

<p>Now for the difficult task of choosing a language. If you look again at the four items on top of
this post, having read the language descriptions above, you might start to see what's going on. This is
basically a matter of choosing the right language for your specific task, with some decisions.</p>

<p><b>Which are my time constraints?</b> Beginner programmers often forget that, for homemade software,
the total time constraint is <i>the time you spend programming</i> plus <i>the time you spend running it</i>.
If the routine is expected to take 10 minutes, don't waste two hours writing a C program with pointers, write
a simple script.</p>

<p><b>Can I solve it with a simple script?</b> If the answer is yes, use <code>bash</code>. It's a great
scripting language, and you can build on top of other Unix tools, like <code>awk</code>, <code>sed</code>, etc.</p>

<p>However, keep in mind that every time you call an external program, the system needs to <code>fork()</code>
and, for large loops, this can be a huge overhead. Be rational, and think again of the execution time.
Instead to launch 10,000 <code>sed</code> to parse lines, it might be better to write a <code>php</code> script, which
is more powerful than <code>bash</code>, it won't need to <code>fork()</code> and the code will probably be simpler.</code>

<p><b>Will I need to maintain it or reuse the code? Will the code grow?</b> If you think this code can be
reused as a library, or integrated into other modules, think of making it into an actual <code>C</code> library
or <code>java</code> class. Running scripts within scripts within a big project is generally a bad idea. And
please keep in mind that, in a research environment, at some point another person will need to look
at your code, so besides writing clean and understandable code, try not to use obscure languages or tools
which only you know of.</p>

<p><b>Do I need to achieve the maximum speed and/or optimizations?</b> Keeping in mind that the latest
versions of the <code>java</code> virtual machine are pretty fast, yes, the winner here is <code>C</code>. But we're
talking about software which can take you two weeks to code, and which would take months to run if written
in <code>perl</code>, but only takes three hours when coded in <code>C</code>. When this happens, choose <code>C</code>.</p>

<p><b>Will it need to run on different platforms?</b> <code>java</code> and the scripting languages are the only
ones which guarantee perfect execution on every environment: Windows, Mac, Linux, Solaris, BSD and others.
<code>C</code> can be compiled in different architectures but it's sometimes hard to replace <code>mmap</code>'s
on Windows or compile against different versions of the <code>libc</code> in different flavors of Linux.</p>

<h4>Summary</h4>

<p>Let's review the four initial points again.</p>

<ol>
<li><code><b>bash</b></code> is a great initial choice for small projects which will take about 20 minutes
to run and you don't want to waste three hours programming them</li>
<li><code><b>php</b></code> is appropriate for medium projects, which use objects, parse text and do math.
<code>perl</code> is another good choice at this point.</li>
<li><code><b>C</b></code> is better left for experts or people who need hardcore optimizations. The rest
of us will leave optimizations for the compiler/interpreter and just try to write good code
which runs in O(n) if possible.</li>
<li><code><b>java</b></code> is the king of tools and libraries, multi-platform, scales great for big
projects, is surprisingly fast and very respectful with novices. Its only drawback is the need of
a <code>java</code> virtual machine, but hey, if you use <code>perl</code> you will need its libraries
installed, too.</li>
</ol>

<p>In the end, everyone has their preferred languages, which is fine. It is far more important to write good
code than it is to choose the language which fits best for a task. However, failing to foresee the importance
of a math routine in the and writing it in <code>perl</code> can lead to the whole research group wasting
time until somebody else writes it in <code>C</code> and makes it 1000x faster. Yep, true story.
So choose wisely.</p>
