<p>It looks like <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20140923/07120428605/law-enforcement-freaks-out-over-apple-googles-decision-to-encrypt-phone-info-default.shtml">the new "encrypted by default" policy on smartphones is freaking out
law enforcement agencies</a>.
Honestly, what were they expecting? They have been abusing laws and courts for so long that we 
are starting to take measures <em>to let private companies protect us from our governments</em>. How twisted is that, huh?</p>

<p>"When I see a police officer now, instead of protected, I feel threatened." That's a bit demagogic but bears
some truth. People seem to have interiorized that concept and we now prefer to have some privacy, regardless
of what police think. Yes, we are so busy caring for
our safety that we don't give a crap if that interferes with the FBI &mdash;probably necessary&mdash;
counterterrorism work.</p>

<p>But wait, is that true? I mean, isn't that reasoning a bit flawed? Are people stupid or careless?</p>

<p>When you think about it for a minute, there is a crucial point. Who is more likely to have resources to circumvent
police investigations? Of course, professional criminals. That's why you can't make a backup of your DVDs, but
pirates can. Professionals always find a way, it's regular citizens who have no means to protect themselves.</p>

<p><a href='img/029-registros.png'><img src='img/029-registros.thumb.png' width="712px"></a></p>

<p>This is a comic I made in 2005 (click to zoom). </p>

<p>It says, "The EU wants to keep a record of phone calls, SMS and emails
as a security measure against terrorism." Then, an Al-Qaeda terrorist who's planning to bomb the twin towers
starts using carrier pigeons. Both his phone and computer are wired to the CIA, but that's of no use now.</p>

<p>As time told, they passed that law, and now everyone's communications are under police eyes. It's ironic, but
nowadays the communications protocol which is the most protected by law is... postal mail.</p>

<p>In the end, it is a false sense of security. We have to give our laptop password to a random guy on an airport
and let him check our email and pictures while real terrorists have a decoy encrypted partition. They can
manage all the hassle, we can't, so they win.</p>

<p>Or better, they will carry paper documents in a briefcase. Expect next decades' spy films to stop portraying criminals
as cyberpunk hackers and go back to the 50's analogic look. In the age of Apple Watches, nobody will suspect that a Casio watch
hides a microfilm with the schematics for a bomb.</p>
