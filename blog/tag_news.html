Spanish media just shot themselves in the foot -- or maybe in the head

<p>In Spain we have an old proverb, <em>La avaricia rompe el saco</em>. Literally <em>"greed bursts the sack"</em>;
it means that if you fill a purse with too many coins
it will break and you will end up with none.</p>

<div class="separator"></div>

<p>This week, the Spanish Congress passed a law with two main goals:</p>

<ul>
<li>Ban torrenting sites, i.e. that is link-only sites (not content hosts), which is a totally different topic.</li>
<li>Make social aggregators pay media publishers for the use of news excerpts.</li>
</ul>

<p>More details can be found on <a href="http://es.gizmodo.com/espana-aprueba-la-ley-de-propiedad-intelectual-y-el-pol-1609066353">this Gizmodo article</a></p>

<p>If this weren't so serious I'd say that news lobbies pressing against the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_to_quote">right to quote</a>, you know, the one their business is based on, is <em>ironic</em>.</p>

<p>But this is so outrageously hypocritical that it's not ironic, it's immoral and vomitive. 
Disgusting. Greedy to the extreme. This is a capital crime against ethics.</p>

<p>So why did they just do that?</p>

<div class="separator"></div>

<p>Last year, <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/02/07/us-europe-google-idUSBRE9160ZM20130207">Google was forced to pay French publishers</a>
for use of their content.
Spanish publisher lobby AEDE (lack of link intended) saw here a huge opportunity: let's do the same and get free money from Google.</p>

<p>Google is so big that's it's an easy target. <a href="http://www.xataka.com/analisis/cronica-de-la-historia-del-mayor-robo-a-internet-jamas-perpetrado">Demagogy is so simple</a>; <em>Google is a tech giant that does fiscal
engineering to avoid paying taxes and profits from our content</em>. Yes, that's true. But Google does
exactly what these publishers do: curate what others say and provide citations to strengthen and validate their job.</p>

<p>But then, Google's natural reaction would have been, <em>"You don't want my traffic? Wish granted! Next time, be careful 
what you wish"</em>. However, AEDE had anticipated this, so with the new law content providers <strong>can't opt out</strong> 
by not linking to AEDE's affiliated media. F*ck off genie, we wished for infinite wishes!</p>

<p>It's so effortless to lobby in a corrupt and manipulated environment <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.es/pilar-portero-y-ana-canil/como-aprobar-la-ley-de-propiedad_b_5610404.html">where politicians don't even know what a link is</a>.</p>

<div class="separator"></div>

<p>But wait, there's more.</p>

<p>Once you start considering the implications of <em>having to pay to hyperlink</em>, things get worse. 
<a href="http://coalicionprointernet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/20140703_Analisis-economico-de-la-modificacion-de-la-LPI_Afi.pdf">A study</a> conducted by <a href="http://coalicionprointernet.com">Coalici&oacute;n Prointernet</a>, a lobby against this law, states the 
obvious:</p>

<ul>
<li>It has not been proved that content aggregation limits the editor's earnings. Of course; it's the opposite, it
actually drives them more traffic&mdash;<a href="http://gallir.wordpress.com/2014/07/22/un-apunte-personal-rapido-sobre-el-canon-aede/">300M yearly visits</a>, according to an admin of one of those sites.</li>
<li>There is no basis to establish an inalienable compensation towards media editors and, if it were any,
this new legislation is not the best way to go.</li>
<li>The new law reduces legal security for Spanish internet companies.</li>
<li>Media aggregation is necessary and positive from a "freedom of speech" standpoint.
Unavailability of aggregators can drive small publishers to extinction and leave users without
an important tool to diversify their media consumption.</li>
</ul>

<p>Please read and think about the last point again, because it is very, very important. </p>

<div class="separator"></div>

<p>Let's summarize what is happening here:</p>

<p>Big media editors AEDE, most of which pro-government, in collusion with the corrupt Spanish politicians have managed a masterstroke which they think will:</p>

<ol>
<li>Get them free money</li>
<li>Destroy the discoverability of smaller media competitors, usually critical with the government</li>
<li>Hinder the future of Spanish internet tech business, their main competitor</li>
<li>Get more exposure, since readers won't have access to media agreggation and will resort to reading just one or two outlets</li>
</ol>

<p>In reality, what is likely to happen is:</p>

<ol>
<li><a href="http://www.xataka.com/analisis/cronica-de-la-historia-del-mayor-robo-a-internet-jamas-perpetrado">Google will close Google News Spain</a>, no big problem</li>
<li>Spanish media aggregators will move their business abroad and won't contribute taxes to the country</li>
<li>Tech enterpreneurs will realize that Spain is a shitty country to invest money on</li>
<li>Without Google, the aggregators, and thanks to the increasing <a href="http://www.elconfidencial.com/tecnologia/2014-03-18/los-medios-aede-pierden-1-7-millones-de-visitas-desde-el-boicot-de-meneame_103436/">user boycott to AEDE media</a>, those editors will lose traffic and money.</li>
</ol>

<div class="separator"></div>

<p>This is so, so sad.</p>

<p>It is clear that traditional media companies are suffering because of the internet revolution and 
need to fight in some way. However, they are cutting their own nose to spite the face. And, in the way,
they are denying others a right, not a banal one, but the right to quote, which news business is built on.</p>

<p>I honestly think that traditional media is absolutely necessary even today. They are the ones who report, research,
discover, analyze and interpret what's happening in the world. Specially in Spain, where we don't have
these modern US internet-only media
companies which don't just feast on press releases but do real journalism.</p>

<p>This is not a cry against traditional media. People, most of all, need them. But people also need 
aggregators to contrast different views on news. Aggregators need media because it's impossible to talk
about news without a headline and an excerpt to reveal what's going on. And media, most of all, needs 
aggregators and people to survive in today's world.</p>

<p>Now the law has been passed. Though it needs to be ratified in the Senate, it is a pantomime
because the majorities are the same as in Congress and also Congress has the last word even if the Senate
votes against it (take that, Montesquieu!). What will media editors do when they start losing money
and realize the harm they have done to themselves, the Government, Spanish media consumers and the Spanish
tech industry?</p>

<p>Next time you think somebody is stupid, remember that the Spanish press just got in a war with Google,
Facebook and Twitter because they want them to stop linking to their content.</p>

<p>Crazy world we live in, huh?</p>

<h3><a class="ablack" href="whats-so-great-about-whatsapp.html">
What's so great about Whatsapp?
</a></h3>
<!-- bashblog_timestamp: #201402201901.00# -->
<div class="subtitle">February 20, 2014 &mdash; 
Carlos Fenollosa
</div>
<!-- text begin -->

<p><a href="http://techcrunch.com/2014/02/19/facebook-buying-whatsapp-for-16b-in-cash-and-stock-plus-3b-in-rsus/">Facebook bought Whatsapp for $19B</a>. There has been a lot of discussion on the net since the
numbers are crazy. Even for today's standards, where startups are measured in <em>Instagram</em>s or <em>Yahoo!</em>s
much like length is measured in football courts, that is a large sum.</p>

<p>To summarize my thoughts on the money; maybe we should start thinking about a new Web 2.0 bubble?
Whether $12B in Facebook shares is actually twelve billion dollars cash is left as an exercise for the reader.
<a href="http://sequoiacapital.tumblr.com/post/77211282835/four-numbers-that-explain-why-facebook-acquired">Smarter people than me</a> defend the acquisition, and I will definitely not argue against that.</p>

<p>So why did Facebook buy Whatsapp? TL;DR: because of what people use it for.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding <a href="http://www.techinasia.com/350-million-registered-users-line-mobile-commerce-future-growth/">Line's 350M users</a>, or the hype with Telegram, Facebook went for Whatsapp
for a reason, and that is because <a href="http://blog.textit.in/your-path-to-a-$16b-exit-build-a-j2me-app">they are huge outside the US</a>.</p>

<p>I don't think this is an acqui-hire as Whatsapp needs every employee and it wouldn't be a smart move
to shut it down while it's #1 with this huge competition. However, Facebook can probably learn a lot
from Whatsapp's engineers. <a href="http://www.erlang-factory.com/upload/presentations/558/efsf2012-whatsapp-scaling.pdf">Their amazing staff</a>
can scale at a ratio of 450M users per 32 engineers. That's 14M users per engineer.
But again, this isn't about the people, the risk of Whatsapp being bought
by Google, or just their user base.</p>

<p>It is most likely the fact that Whatsapp has more than 300M daily active users, and Facebook could greatly benefit
from having all these people's data. Remember what Facebook, and all the other big companies on the net, are. They
are advertisers. And all these people using Whatsapp is communicating outside Facebook's network.</p>

<p>Google wants to collect all the world's data, but Facebook wants to know everything about people. Now it will
reach an additional 450M that they weren't previously controlling. </p>

<p>What's so special about Whatsapp users? From my experience, Whatsapp is a great mix of Instagram, Twitter,
chat and Facebook. It is totally spontaneous, friendly, private, and chaotic. Non-geeks love the ability
to send pics, text and audio and let messages scroll to the top. It is so comfortable to use.</p>

<p>But what's more interesting, users communicate intentions,
meetings, events. Outside the US, nobody creates Facebook events any more; we create Whatsapp groups.
Groups for parties, dinner, quick stuff that's happening and needs immediate action. We use Facebook to
discuss what happened &mdash;maybe with a cool beach pic&mdash; but Whatsapp is all about the immediate future.
Plans are made on Whatsapp.</p>

<p>And here goes my conclusion. What could be sweeter for Facebook's advertisers than knowing in advance what
people are up to? It's the perfect user data.
Remember, next time you create a Whatsapp group for that birthday party, restaurant ads will pop in your Facebook.
And I'm not saying that it's a bad thing necessarily.</p>
